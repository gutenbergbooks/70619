</div>

<p class='c007'>It is perhaps vain to attempt to tone down the audacity of the
present essay by any explanations or limitations; it is certain
that those who are offended by it at first blush are very unlikely
to be propitiated by excuses of the faults which, excusably
or inexcusably, it no doubt contains. The genesis of it
is as follows. When, not much less than thirty years ago,
the writer was first asked to undertake the duty of a critic,
he had naturally to overhaul his own acquaintance with the
theory and practice of criticism, and to inquire what was the
acquaintance of others therewith. The disconcerting smallness
of the first was a little compensated by the discovery that
very few persons seemed to be much better furnished. Dr
Johnson’s projected “History of Criticism, as it relates to
Judging of Authours” no doubt has had fellows in the great
library of books unwritten. But there were then, and I believe
there are still, only two actual attempts to deal with the whole
subject. One of these<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> I have never seen, and indeed had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>never heard of till nearly the whole of the present volume
was written. Moreover, it seems to be merely a torso. The
other, Théry’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Histoire des Opinions Littéraires</cite></span>,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a> a book which,
after two editions at some interval, has been long out of print,
is a work of great liveliness, no small knowledge, and, in its
airy French kind, a good deal of acuteness. But the way in
which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Critique Arabe,”</span> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Critique Juive,”</span> &amp;c., are knocked off
in a page or a paragraph at one end, and the way in which,
at the other—though the second edition was published when
Mr Arnold was just going to write, and the first when Coleridge,
and Hazlitt, and Lamb had already written—the historian
knows of nothing English later than Campbell and Blair, are
things a little disquieting. At any rate, neither of these was
then known to me, and I had, year by year, to pick up for
myself, and piece together, the greater and lesser classics of the
subject in a haphazard and groping fashion.</p>

<p class='c001'>This volume—which will, fortune permitting, be followed by
a second dealing with the matter from the Renaissance to the
death of eighteenth-century Classicism, and by a third on
Modern Criticism—is an attempt to supply for others, on the
basis of these years of reading, the Atlas of which the writer
himself so sorely felt the need. He may have put elephants
for towns, he may have neglected important rivers and mountains,
like a general from the point of view of a newspaper
correspondent, or a newspaper correspondent from the point of
view of a general; but he has done what he could.</p>

<p class='c001'>The book, the plan of which was accepted by my publishers
some five or six years ago, before I was appointed to the Chair
which I have the honour to hold, has been delayed in its composition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>partly by work previously undertaken, partly by professional
duties. But it has probably not been injured by the
necessity of reading, for these duties, some four or five times
over again, the <cite>Poetics</cite> and the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, the <cite>Institutes</cite> and the
Περὶ Ὕψους,, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span> and the <cite>Discoveries</cite>, the
<cite>Essay of Dramatic Poesy</cite> and the <cite>Preface to Lyrical Ballads</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>I do not know whether some apology may be expected
from a man whom readers, if they know him at all, are likely
to know only as a student of modern literature, for the
presumption of making his own translations from Greek and
Latin. But when one has learnt these languages for twelve
or fifteen years, taught them for eight more, and read them
for nearly another five-and-twenty, it seems rather pusillanimous
to take cover behind “cribs.” I have aimed throughout
rather at closeness than at elegance. An apology of another
kind may be offered for the biographical and lexicographical
details which, at the cost of some trouble, have been incorporated
in the Index. Everybody has not a classical dictionary
at hand, and probably few people have a full rhetorical
lexicon. Yet it was inevitable, in a book of this kind, that a
large number of persons, books, and words should be introduced,
as to the date, the contents, the meaning of which or of whom,
the ordinary reader might require some enlightenment. Information
of the sort would have made the text indigestible and
have overballasted the notes; so I have put it in the Index,
where those who do not want it need not seek it, and where
those who seek will, I hope, find.</p>

<p class='c001'>It only remains to thank, with a heartiness not easily to be
expressed, the friends who have been good enough to read my
proofs and to give me the benefit of their special knowledge.
Not always does the restless explorer of literature at large
who, knowing that here also “the merry world is round And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>[he] may sail for evermore,” elects to be a world-wanderer,
receive, from the legitimate authorities of the ports into which
he puts, a genuine welcome, cheerful victualling, and assistance
in visiting the adjacent provinces. Sometimes they fire into
him, sometimes they deny him food and water, often they look
upon him as a filibuster, or an interloper, or presumptuous.
But Professor Butcher, Professor Hardie, and Professor Ker,
who have had the exceeding kindness to read each the portion
of this volume which belongs to him more specially of right,
have not only given me invaluable suggestions and corrections,
but have even encouraged me to hope that my treatment, however
far it may fall short of what is desirable, is not grossly
and impudently inadequate. May all other competent persons
be equally lenient!</p>

    <div>NOTE TO SECOND EDITION.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='small'>Since this book was first printed, I have remembered that the story
about Malatesta and the bones (note, p. 124) is told by Mr Symonds in
more than one place (<i>e.g.</i>, <cite>The Revival of Learning</cite>, new ed., p. 151) of
<cite>Gemistus</cite> Pletho, the well-known Grecian and Platonist, whose appearance
in Italy so much excited Humanism. This is, for many reasons, much
more probable; but the mistake of “Themistius,” if mistake it be, is not
mine but Dindorf’s, or rather that of Keyssler, from whom Dindorf
quotes an account of the matter, and an apparently literal transcript of

<p class='c007'>It is perhaps always desirable that the readers of a book should
have a clear idea of what the writer of it proposes to give them:
it is very certainly desirable that such an idea should
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Delimitation of frontier.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
exist in the writer himself. But if this is the case
generally, it must be more especially the case where there is at
least some considerable danger of ambiguity. And that there
is such danger, in regard to the title of the present book, not
many persons, I suppose, would think of denying. The word
Criticism is often used, not merely with the laxity common to all
such terms, but in senses which are not so much extensions of
each other as digressions into entirely different <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>genera</i></span>. In
the following pages it will be used as nearly as possible
univocally. The Criticism which will be dealt with here is
that function of the judgment which busies itself with the
goodness or badness, the success or ill-success, of literature from
the purely literary point of view. Other offices of the critic,
real or so-called, will occupy us slightly or not at all. We shall
meddle little with the more transcendental Æsthetic, with those
ambitious theories of Beauty, and of artistic Pleasure in general,
which, fascinating and noble as they appear, have too often
proved cloud-Junos. The business of interpretation, a most
valuable and legitimate side-work of his, though perhaps only a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>side-work, will have to be glanced at, as we come to modern
times, with increasing frequency. We shall not be able entirely
to leave out of the question, though we shall not greatly trouble
ourselves with it, what is called the “verbal” part of his office—the
authentication or extrusion of this or that “reading.” But we
shall, as far as possible, neglect and decline what may perhaps best
be called the Art of Critical Coscinomancy, by which the critic
affects to discern, separate, and rearrange, on internal evidence
not of a literary character, the authorship and date of books.
Of the Criticism, so-called, which has performed its chief exploits
in Biblical discussion, which has meddled a good deal with the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Classes of Criticism excluded.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Classics, and which occupies, in regard to the older
and therefore more tempting documents of modern
literature, a position of activity midway between that
exercised towards the sacred writings and that exercised
towards Greek and Roman authors, no word will, except by
some accidental necessity, be found in these pages. The
rules and canons of this Criticism are different from, and in
most cases antagonistic to, those of Criticism proper: its
objects are entirely distinct; and in particular it, for the most
part if not wholly, neglects the laws of Logic. Now Criticism
proper, which is but in part a limitation, in part an extension,
of Rhetoric, never parts company with Rhetoric’s elder sister.</p>

<p class='c001'>In other words, the Criticism or modified Rhetoric, of which
this book attempts to give a history, is pretty much the same
thing as the reasoned exercise of Literary Taste—the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Class retained.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
attempt, by examination of literature, to find out
what it is that makes literature pleasant, and therefore good—the
discovery, classification, and as far as possible tracing to
their sources, of the qualities of poetry and prose, of style and
metre, the classification of literary kinds, the examination and
“proving,” as arms are proved, of literary means and weapons,
not neglecting the observation of literary fashions and the like.
It will follow from this that the History must pursue the
humble <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a posteriori</i></span> method. Except on the rarest
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Method.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
occasions, when it may be safe to generalise, it will
confine itself wholly to the particular and the actual. We shall
not busy ourselves with what men ought to have admired, what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>they ought to have written, what they ought to have thought,
but with what they did think, write, admire. To some, no
doubt, this will give an appearance of plodding, if not of pusillanimity;
but there may be others who will recognise in it, not
so much a great refusal, as an honest attempt to provide some
sound and useful knowledge which does not exist in any
accessible form,—to raise, by whatsoever humble drudgery,
vantage-points from which more aspiring persons than the
writer may take Pisgah-sights, if they please, without fear of
their support collapsing under them in the manner of a tub.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has further seemed desirable, if not absolutely necessary
for the carrying out of this scheme, to confine ourselves mainly
to the actual texts. This is not, perhaps, a fashionable
proceeding. Not what Plato says, but what the latest
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Texts the chief object.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
commentator says about Plato—not what Chaucer
says, but what the latest thesis-writer thinks about Chaucer—is
supposed to be the qualifying study of the scholar. I am not
able to share this conception of scholarship. When we have
read and digested the whole of Plato, we may, if we like, turn
to his latest German editor; when we have read and digested
the whole of Shakespeare, and of Shakespeare’s contemporaries,
we may, if we like, turn to Shakespearian biographers and commentators.
But this extension of inquiry, to apply a famous
contrast, is facultative, not necessary. At any rate, in the
following pages it is proposed to set forth, and where necessary
to discuss, what Plato, Aristotle, Dionysius, Longinus,
what Cicero and Quintilian, what Dante and Dryden, what
Corneille and Coleridge, with many a lesser man besides, have
said about literature, noticing by the way what effect these
authorities have had on the general judgment, and what, as
often happens, the general judgment has for the time made
up its mind to, without troubling itself about authorities.
But we shall only occasionally busy ourselves with what
others, not themselves critically great, have said about these
great critics, and that from no arrogance, but for two reasons
of the most inoffensive character. In the first place, there
is no room to handle both text and margent, with the
margent’s margent <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad infinitum</i></span>. In the second, the handling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>of the margent would distinctly obscure the orderly setting
forth of the texts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, further, leave will be taken to neglect guesswork as
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>"Hypotheses non fingo."<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
far as possible, and for the most part, if not invariably,
to refrain from building any hypotheses
upon titles, casual citations, or mere probabilities.</p>

<p class='c001'>To illustrate what is meant, let us take a book which every
one who makes such an attempt as this must mention with
the utmost gratitude and respect, the admirable <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Essai sur
l'Histoire de la Critique chez les Grecs</cite></span><a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a> of the late M. Egger.
That excellent scholar and most agreeable writer was perhaps
as free from “hariolation” as any one who has ever
dealt with classical subjects; yet the first ninety pages of his
book are practically in the air. The judges of rhapsodical
competitions were the first critics; the Homeric edition of
Pisistratus presupposes and implies criticism, which is equally—which
is even more—presupposed and implied in the choragic
system of Athens, whereby plots were chosen for performance;
there are known to have been successive and corrected versions
of plays, from which the same conclusions may be drawn. We
are told, and can readily believe, that the actors had their parts
suited to them, and this means criticism. Nay, was not the
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Illustration from M. Egger.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
whole Comedy, the Old Comedy at least, a criticism,
and often a purely literary one? Is not the <cite>Frogs</cite>,
in particular, a dramatised “review” of the most
slashing kind? And have we not even the titles, at least, of
regular treatises, presumably critical, by Pratinas, by Lasus, by
the great Sophocles himself?</p>

<p class='c001'>Now all this is probable; nearly all of it is interesting, and
some of it is, so far as it goes, certain. But then as a certainty
it goes such a very little way! M. Egger himself, with the
frankness which the scholar ought to have, but has not always,
admits the justice of the reproach of one of his critics, that part
of it is conjecture. It would scarcely be harsh to say that all of
it is, in so far as any solid information as to the critical habits
of the Greeks is furnished by it. In the pages that follow at
least a steady effort will be made to discard the conjectural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>altogether, and to reduce even the amount of superstructure on
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Documents.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
second-hand foundations to the minimum. The extant
written word, as it is the sole basis of all sound
criticism in regard to particulars, so it is the only sound basis
for the history of Criticism in general. The enormous losses
which we have suffered in this department of Greek literature,
and the scanty supply which, except in the department of the
Lower Rhetoric, seems to be all that existed in Latin, may
appear to make the effort to conduct inquiry in this way a rash
or a barren one; but the present writer at least is convinced
that no effort can usefully be made in any other. And after <span class='sni side3'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Greek.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
all, though so much is lost, much remains. In point
of tendency we can ask for nothing better than
Plato, provoking and elusive as he may seem in individual
utterances; in point of particular expression and indication of
general lines, the <cite>Rhetoric</cite> and the <cite>Poetics</cite> of Aristotle are
admittedly priceless; and such writers as Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
as Plutarch, as Dion Chrysostom, as Lucian, and above
all as Longinus, leave us very little reason to complain, even
when we turn from the comparative scantiness of this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>corpus</i></span> to
the comparative wealth of arid rhetorical term-splitting which
still remains to us.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is it at all probable that if we had more Latin literary
criticism we should be so very much better off. For, once more,<span class='sni side3'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Roman.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the existing work of such men as Cicero, Quintilian,
Tacitus, and above all Horace, with the literary
allusions of the later satirists, not to mention for the present
the gossip of Aulus Gellius and the like, gives more than
sufficient “tell-tales.” We can see the nature and the limitations
of Roman criticism in these as well as if they filled a
library.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the great stretch of time—some thousand years—between
the decadence of the pure Classics and the appearance of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Mediæval.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Renaissance it is not the loss but the absence of
material that is the inconvenience, and this inconvenience
is again tolerable. The opinions of the Dark and
Early Middle Ages on the Classics themselves are only a curiosity;
for real criticism or matured judgment on existing work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>in the vernacular they had little opportunity even in a single
language, for comparative work still less. Only the astonishing
and strangely undervalued tractate of Dante remains to show us
what might have been done; the rest is curious merely.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the Renaissance has no sooner come than our difficulties
assume a different form, and increase as we approach our
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Renaissance and Modern.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
own times. It is now not deficiency but superabundance
of material that besets us; and if this
work reaches its second volume, a rigid process of selection and
of representative treatment will become necessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in this first the problem is how to extract from
comparatively, though not positively, scanty material a history
that, without calling in guesswork to its assistance, shall present
a fairly adequate account of the Higher Rhetoric and
Poetic, the theory and practice of Literary Criticism and Taste,
during ancient and during mediæval times. At intervals the
narrative and examination will be interrupted for the purpose
of giving summaries of a kind necessarily more temerarious
and experimental than the body of the book, but even
here no attempt will be made at hasty generalisation. Where
the path has been so little trodden, the loyal road-layer will
content himself with making it straight and firm, with fencing
it from precipices, and ballasting it across morasses as well as
he can, leaving others to stroll off on side-tracks to agreeable
view-points, and to thread loops of cunning expatiation.</p>

<p class='c001'>In conclusion, with special regard to this Book and the next,
I would, very modestly but very strenuously, deprecate a line
of comment which is not unusual from exclusively classical
students, and which stigmatises “judging ancient literature
from modern points of view.” Such a process is no doubt even
more grossly wrong than that (not unknown) of judging modern
literature from ancient standpoints. But the true critic admits
neither. He endeavours—a hard and ambitious task!—to extract
from <em>all</em> literature, ancient, mediæval, and modern, lessons of
its universal qualities, which may enable him to see each period
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sub specie æternitatis</i></span>. And nothing less than this—with the
Muses to help—is the adventure of this work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although we have, putting aside Aristophanes, an almost
utter dearth of actual texts before Plato, it is possible, without
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Earliest criticism of the Greeks.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
violating the principles laid down in the foregoing
chapter, to discern some general currents, and a few
individual deliverances, of Greek criticism<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> in earlier
ages. The earliest character of this criticism that we perceive
is, as we should expect, a tendency towards allegorical explanations
of literature. And the earliest subject of this that we
discover is, again as we should expect, the work attributed to
Homer.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we had older and more certain testimony about the fact,
and still more about the exact character, of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Probably Homeric in subject.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
world-famous Pisistratean redaction of the Homeric
and other poems, it would be necessary to reverse
the order of this statement; and even as it is, the utmost critical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>caution may admit that it was probably with Homer that
Greek criticism began. We shall find nothing so constantly
borne out in the whole course of this history as the fact—self-evident,
but constantly neglected in its consequences—that
criticism is a vine which must have its elm or other support
to fasten on. And putting aside all the endless and (from
some points of view at least) rather fruitless disputes about
the age, the authorship, and so forth, of Homer, we know, from
what is practically the unanimous and unintentional testimony of
the whole of Greek literature, that “Homer” and the knowledge
of Homer were anterior to almost all of it. And it was impossible
that a people so acute and so philosophically given as
the Greeks should be soaked in Homer, almost to the same
extent as that to which the English lower and middle classes of
the seventeenth century were soaked in the Bible, without
being tempted to exercise their critical faculties upon the
poems. It was long, as we shall see, before this exercise took
the form of strictly literary criticism, of the criticism which
(with the provisos and limitations of the last chapter) we call
æsthetic. It was once said that the three functions of criticism
in its widest sense are to interpret, to verify or sanction, and
to judge, the last being its highest and purest office.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Probably allegoric in method.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But the other two commend themselves perhaps
more to the natural man—they certainly commended
themselves more to the Greeks—and we should expect
to find them, as we do find them, earlier practised. The Pisistratean
redaction, if a fact (as in some form or other it pretty
certainly was), is an enterprise both bold and early in the one
direction; there is no reason to doubt that many enterprises
were made pretty early in the other; and not much to doubt
that most of these experiments in interpretation took the
allegorical form.</p>

<p class='c001'>Modern readers and modern critics have usually a certain
dislike to Allegory, at least when she presents herself honestly
and by her own name. Her government has no doubt at times
been something despotic, and her votaries and partisans have at
times been almost intolerably tedious and absurd. Yet in the
finer sorts of literature, at any rate, the apprehension of some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>sort of allegory, of some sort of double meaning, is almost a
necessity. The student of any kind of poetry, and the student
of the more imaginative prose, can never rest satisfied with the
mere literal and grammatical sense, which belongs not to literature
but to science. He cannot help seeking some hidden
meaning, something further, something behind, if it be only
rhythmical beauty, only the suggestion of pleasure to the ear and
eye and heart. Nor ought he to help it. But the ill repute of
Allegory arises from the ease with which her aid is borrowed
to foist religious, philosophical, and other sermons into the
paradise of art. This danger was especially imminent in a
country like Greece, where religion, philosophy, literature, and
art of all kinds were, from the earliest times, almost inextricably
connected and blended.</p>

<p class='c001'>Accordingly allegory, and that reverse or seamy side of
allegory, rationalistic interpretation, seem to have made their
appearance very early in Greece. This latter has only to do
with literary criticism in the sense that it is, and always has
been, a very great degrader thereof, inclining it to be busy with
matter instead of form. The allegorising tendency proper is
not quite so dangerous, though still dangerous enough. But in
the second-hand and all too scanty notices that we have of the
early philosophers, it is evident that the two tendencies met
and crossed in them almost bewilderingly. When Xenophanes
found fault with the Homeric anthropomorphism, when Anaxagoras
and others made the scarcely audacious identification of
the arrows of Apollo with the rays of the sun, and the bolder one
of Penelope’s web with the processes of the syllogism, they were
anticipating a great deal which has presented itself as criticism
(whether it had any business to do so or not) in the last two
thousand and odd hundred years. We have not a few names,
given by more or less good authority and less or more known
independently, of persons—Anaximander, Stesimbrotus, a certain
Glaucus or Glaucon, and others—who early devoted themselves
to allegorical interpretation of Homer and perhaps of other
poets; but we have hardly even fragments of their work, and
we can found no solid arguments upon what is told us of it.
Only we can see dimly from these notices, clearly from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>fuller and now trustworthy evidence which we find in Plato,
that their criticism was criticism of matter only,—that they
treated Homer as a historical, a religious, a philosophical
document, not as a work of art.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, as one turns over the volumes of Karsten<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a> and

a su de tous les temps</i></span>,—one sees, scanty as they are, how very
unlikely it is that, if we had more, there would be anything in
it that would serve our present purpose. These Greeks, at
any rate, <em>were</em> children—children of genius, children of extraordinary
promise, children almost of that gigantic breed which
has to be stifled lest it grow too fast. But, like children in
general, when they have any great mental development, they
scorned what seemed to them little things. And, also like
children, they had not and could not have the accumulation of
knowledge of particulars which is necessary for the criticism of
art. The audacious monopantheism of Xenophanes could not,
we are sure, have stooped to consider, not as it actually did<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
whether Homer and Hesiod were blasphemers, but whether
they did their blaspheming with technical cunning. In its sublimer
moments and in its moments of discussion, in those of
the famous single line—</p>

<p class='c019'>as well as in the satire on the ox- and lion-creed of lions and
oxen, it would have equally scorned the attempt to substitute
for mere opinion a humble inductive approach to knowledge
on the differences of Poetry and prose and the proper definition
of Comedy. Even in those milder moods when the philosopher
gave, if he did give, receipts for the proper mode of mixing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>negus,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a> and was not insensible to the charms of a soft couch,
sweet wine, and devilled peas,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a> one somehow does not see him
as a critic.</p>

<p class='c001'>How much less even does one see anything of the kind in
the few and great verses of Parmenides, that extraordinary link
of union between Homer and Lucretius, the poet of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Parmenides.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the “gates of the ways of night and day,”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a> the
philosopher whose teaching is of that which “is and cannot but
be?”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a> the seer whose sight was ever “straining straight at the
rays of the sun”?<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a> We shall see shortly how a more chastened
and experienced idealism, combined in all probability with a
much wider actual knowledge of literature and art, made the
literary criticism of Plato a blend of exquisite rhapsody and
childish crotchet. In the much earlier day of Parmenides
not even this blend was to be expected. There could hardly by
any possibility have been anything but the indulgence in
allegorising which is equally dear to poets and philosophers,
and perhaps the inception of a fanciful philology. Metaphysics
and physics sufficed, with a little creative literature. For
criticism there could be no room.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it will be said, Empedocles? Empedocles who, according
to some traditions, was the inventor of Rhetoric—who certainly
was a native of the island where Rhetoric arose—the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Empedocles.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
chief speaker among these old philosophers?
That Empedocles had a good deal of the critical temper may
be readily granted. He has little or nothing of the sublime
beliefs of Parmenides; his scepticism is much more thorough-going
than that which certainly does appear in the philosopher
of Colophon. If a man do not take the discouragement of it
too much to heart there is, perhaps, no safer and saner frame of
mind for the critic than that expressed in the strongest of all
the Empedoclean fragments, that which tells us how “Men,
wrestling through a little space of life that is no life, whirled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>off like a vapour by quick fate, flit away, each persuaded but
of that with which he has himself come in contact, darting this
way and that. But the Whole man boasts to find idly; not
to be seen are these things by men, nor heard, nor grasped by
their minds. Thou shalt know no more than human counsel
has reached.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a> An excellent critical mood, if not pushed to
mere inaction and despair: but there is no evidence that it
led Empedocles to criticism. Physics and ethics appear to
have absorbed him wholly.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the sophist was the first rhetorician would be allowed
by his accusers as well as by his apologists: and though Rhetoric
long followed wandering fires before it recognised its true star and
became Literary Criticism, yet nobody doubts that we must look
to it for what literary criticism we shall find in these times.
The Sophists, on the very face of the charge constantly brought
against them of attending to words merely, are almost acknowledged
to be the inventors of Grammar; while from the
other charge that they corrupted youth by teaching them to
talk fluently, to make the worse the better reason, and the
like, it will equally follow that they practised the deliberate
consideration of style. Grammar is only the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ancilla</i></span> of
criticism, but a tolerably indispensable one; the consideration
of style is at least half of criticism itself. Accordingly the
two first persons in whose work (if we had it) we might expect
to find a considerable body of literary criticism, if only literary
criticism of a scrappy, tentative, and outside kind, are the two
great sophists Gorgias and Protagoras, contemporaries, but representatives
of almost the two extremities of the little Greek
world, of Leontini and Abdera, of Sicily and Thrace.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have indeed a whole catalogue of work that should have
been critical or nothing ascribed by Diogenes Laertius<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a> to the still
greater contemporary and compatriot of Protagoras, Democritus.
How happily would the days of Thalaba (supposing Thalaba
to be a historian of criticism) go by, if he had that little library
of works which Diogenes thus assigns and calls "Of <em>Music</em>"!
They are eight in number: “On Rhythm and Harmony,” “On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Poetry” (one would compound for this alone), “On the Beauty
of Words,”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c008'><sup>[15]</sup></a> “On Well- and Ill-sounding Letters,” “On Homer or
Right Style and Glosses,”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c008'><sup>[16]</sup></a> “On the Aoedic Art,” “On Verbs(?),”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c008'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
and an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Onomasticon</cite></span>. But Democritus lived in the fifth
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Democritus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
century before Christ, and Diogenes in the second
century after Christ; the historian’s attribution is unsupported,
and he has no great character for accuracy; while, worst of
all, he himself tells us that there were six Democriti, and that
of the other five one was a musician, another an epigrammatist,
and a third (most suspiciously) a technical writer on rhetoric.
It stands fatally to reason that as all these (save the Chian
musician) seem to have been more modern, and as the works
mentioned would exactly fall in with the business of the
musician and the teacher of rhetoric, they are far more likely,
if they ever existed (and Diogenes seems to cite rather the
catalogue of a certain Thrasylus than the books themselves),
<em>not</em> to have been the work of the Laughing Philosopher. At any
rate, even if they were, we are utterly ignorant of their tenor.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the other great Abderite, Protagoras, the disciple of
Democritus himself, wrote on subjects of the kind, there can
be no reasonable doubt. It is practically impossible that he
should not have done so, though we have not the exact title
of any. He is said to have been the first to distinguish the
parts of an oration by name, to have made some important
advances in technical grammar, and to have lectured on the
poets. But here again we have no texts to appeal to, nor
any certain fact.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet perhaps it is not mere critical whim to doubt whether, if
we had these texts also, we should be much further advanced.
The titles of those attributed to Democritus, if we could accept
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Sophists—earlier.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the attribution with any confidence, would make
such scepticism futile. But we have no titles of
critical works attributed to Protagoras; we only know vaguely
that he lectured on the poets.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c008'><sup>[18]</sup></a> And from all the stories
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>about him as well as from the famous dialogue which puts the
hostile view of his sophistry, we can conclude with tolerable
certainty that his interests were mainly ethical, with perhaps a
dash of grammar—the two notes, as we have seen and shall
see, of all this early Greek criticism. Certainly this was the
case with the Sicilian school which traditionally founded
Rhetoric—Empedocles himself perhaps, Corax, Tisias, Gorgias,
and the pupil of Gorgias, Polus, with more certainty. Here
again most of our best evidence is hostile, and therefore to
be used with caution; but the hostility does not affect the
present point. Socrates or Plato could have put unfavourable
views of Sophistic quite as well—indeed, considering Plato’s
curious notions of inventive art, perhaps better—in regard
to Æsthetics. If ethics and philology, not criticism proper, are
the subjects in which their adversaries try to make Protagoras
and Gorgias cut a bad figure, we may be perfectly certain that
these were the subjects in which they themselves tried to cut a
good one. If they are not misrepresented—are not indeed
represented at all—in the strict character of the critic, it can
only be because they did not, for good or for ill, assume that
character. The philosophy of language, the theory of persuasion,
the moral character of poetry and oratory, these were the
subjects which interested them and their hearers; not the
sources of literary beauty, the division of literary kinds, the
nature and varieties of style. Wherever ethic and metaphysic
are left, the merest philology seems to have been the only
alternative—the few phrases attributed to any writers of this
period that bear a different complexion being <em>very</em> few, uncertainly
authentic, and in almost every case extremely
vague.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing else could reasonably be expected when we consider
the nature of Rhetoric as we find it exhibited in Aristotle himself,
and as it was certainly conceived by its first inventors or
nomenclators. It was the Art of Persuasion—the Art of producing
a practical effect—almost the Art of Succeeding in Life.
We shall see when we come to Aristotle himself that this was
as inevitable <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> as it is certain in fact: for the present
the certainty of the fact itself may content us. Where the few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>recorded or imputed utterances of the later sophists do touch
on literature they bear (with a certain additional ingenious
wire-drawing) the same marks as those of the early philosophers.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Sophists—later.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They play upon the “honourable deceit” of
tragedy;<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c008'><sup>[19]</sup></a> they tread harder the old road of allegorical
interpretations;<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c008'><sup>[20]</sup></a> they dwell on words and their nature;<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c008'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
or else, overshooting mark as far as elsewhere they fall short
of it, they attempt ambitious theories of beauty in general,
whether it is “harmony,” utility, sensual pleasure, what not.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c008'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
This is—to adopt the useful, if accidental, antithesis of metaphysic—metacritic,
not criticism. And we shall not, I think, be
rash in assuming that if we had the texts, which we have not,
we should find—we are most certainly not rash in saying that
in the actual texts we do find—nothing but excursions in the
vestibules of Criticism proper, or attempts more or less in vain
upon her secret chambers,—no expatiation whatever in her
main and open halls.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c008'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Two only, and those two of the very greatest, of Greek
writers before Aristotle—Plato and Aristophanes—furnish us
with literary criticism proper, while of these two the first is
a critic almost against his will, and the second one merely for
the nonce. Yet we may be more than thankful for what they
give us, and for the slight reinforcement, as regards the nature
of pre-Aristotelian criticism, which we derive from a third and
much lesser man—Isocrates.</p>

<p class='c001'>It could not possibly be but that so great a writer as Plato,
with an <em>ethos</em> so philosophical as his, should display a strong
<span class='sni side3'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Plato.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
critical element. Yet there were in him other
elements and tendencies, which repressed and distorted
his criticism. To begin with, though he less often
lingered in the vestibule than his enemies the sophists, he was
by the whole tendency of his philosophy even more prompted
than they were to make straight for the adytum, neglecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the main temple. Some form of the Ideal Theory is indeed
necessary to the critic: the beauty of literature is hardly accessible,
except to one who is more or less a Platonist. No system
so well accounts for the ineffable poetic pleasure, the sudden
“gustation of God” which poetry gives, as that of an archetypal
form of every possible thought and passion, as well as
person and thing, to which as the poet approaches closer and
closer, so he gives his readers the deeper and truer thrill.
But Plato’s unfortunate impatience of anything but the idea
pure and simple, led him all wrong in criticism. Instead of
welcoming poetry for bringing him nearer to the impossible and
unattainable, he chides it for interfering with possession and
attainment. In the <cite>Phædrus</cite> and the <cite>Republic</cite> especially, but
also elsewhere, poetic genius, poetic charm, poetry itself, are
described, if not exactly defined, with an accuracy which had
never been reached before, and which has never been surpassed
since; in the same and other places the theory of Imitation, or,
as it might be much better called, Representation, is outlined
with singular acuteness and, so far as we know, originality,
though it is pushed too far; and remarks on the divisions of
literature, at least of poetry, show that a critic of the highest
order is but a little way off. But then comes that everlasting
ethical and political preoccupation which is at once the real
forte and the real foible of the Greek genius, and (with some
other peculiarities) succeeds to a great extent in neutralising the
philosopher’s critical position as a whole. In the first place,
the “imitation” theory (imperfectly grasped owing to causes to
be more fully dealt with later) deposes the poet from his proper
position, and, combined with will-worship of the Idea, prevents
Plato from seeing that the poet’s duty, his privilege, his real
reason for existence, is to “<em>dis</em>-realise,” to give us things not as
they are but as they are not. In the second, that curious,
interesting, and in part most fruitful and valuable Manichæism
which Idealism so often comports, makes him gradually
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His crotchets.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
look more and more down on Art as Art,
more and more take imagination and invention as sinful human
interferences with “reminiscence,” and the simple acceptance of
the Divine. In the third place, the heresy of instruction grows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>on him, and makes him constantly look, not at the intrinsic
value of poetry, its connection with beauty, its importance to
the free adult human spirit, but at its position in reference to
the young, the private citizen, and so forth. These things sufficiently
account for the at first sight almost unintelligible,
though exquisitely put, caprices of the <cite>Republic</cite> and the <cite>Laws</cite>,
which at their worst represent the man of letters and the man
of art generally as a dangerous and anti-social nuisance, at the
very best admit him as a sort of Board-Schoolmaster, to be
rigidly kept in his place, and to be well inspected, coded, furnished
with schedules and rules of behaviour, in order that he
may not step out of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even here, as always, there is some excuse for the choice
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cum Platone errare</i></span>, not merely in the exquisiteness of the
literary form which this unworthy view of literature takes, but
in the fact that, as usual, Plato could not go wrong without
going also right. He had probably seen in Athenian life, and
he had certainly anticipated in his instinctive command of
human nature, the complementary error and curse of “Art for
Art only”—of the doctrine (itself, like his own, partly true, but,
like his own also, partly false and mischievous) of the moral
irresponsibility of the artist. And looking first at morals and
politics with that almost feverish eagerness of the Greek
philosopher, which was in great part justified by the subsequent
Greek collapse in both, he shot wide of the bow-hand from the
purely critical point of aim.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet where shall we find earlier in time, where shall we find
nobler in tone at any time, a critical position to match with that
of the <cite>Phædrus</cite> and the <cite>Ion</cite> as wholes, and of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His compensations.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
many other passages? That “light and winged and
sacred thing the poet” had never had his highest functions so
celebrated before, though in the very passage which so celebrates
him the antithesis of art and delirium be dangerously over-worked.
Alas! it is in the power of all of us to avoid bad
art, and it is not in the power of us all to secure good delirium!
But this matters little, or at worst not so very much. No one
can acknowledge more heartily than Plato—no one has acknowledged
more poetically—that the poet is not a mere moralist, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>mere imitator, a mere handler of important subjects. And from
no one, considering his other views, could the acknowledgment
come with greater force and greater authority. In him and in
that great enemy of his master, to whom we come next, we find
first expressed that real enthusiasm for literature of which the
best, the only true, criticism is but a reasoned variety.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we but possessed that ode or pæan of Tynnichus<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c008'><sup>[24]</sup></a> of
Chalcis, which, it would appear from the <cite>Ion</cite>,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c008'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Plato not merely
thought the only good thing among its author’s works, but
regarded as a masterpiece in itself! If we could but ourselves
compare the works of Antimachus with those of the more
popular Ch&oelig;rilus, to which Plato himself is said to have so
much preferred them that he sent to Colophon to have a copy
made for his own use! Then we might know what his real literary
preferences in the way of poetry were, instead of being put
off with beautiful, invaluable, but hopelessly vague enthusiasms
about poetic beauty in the abstract, and with elaborate polemics
against Homer and Hesiod from a point of view which is not
the point of view of literary criticism at all. But these things
have been grudged us. There are assertions, which we would
not only fain believe, but have no difficulty whatever in believing,
that the aversion to poets represented in the <cite>Republic</cite> and
the <cite>Laws</cite> was, if not feigned, hypothetical and, as one may say,
professional. But this, though a comfort generally, is of no
assistance to us in our present inquiry. The old comparison of
the lantern “high, far-shining, <em>empty</em>” recurs depressingly.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c008'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>There have been periods, not the happiest, but also not the
least important of her history, when Criticism herself would
have absolutely fenced her table against Aristophanes.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Aristophanes.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
That a poet, and a dramatic poet, and a
dramatic poet who permitted himself the wildest excesses of
farce, should be dignified with the name of critic, would have
seemed to the straiter sect a monstrous thing. Yet the Old
Greek Comedy was emphatically “a criticism of life,” and
as such it could not fail to meddle with such an important
part of Athenian life as Athenian literature. It might be
not uninteresting, but is at best superfluous, if not positively
irrelevant here, to point out how important that
part was; the fact is certain. And while it is going rather
a long way round to connect the rivalries of serious poets,
and the alterations which these or other causes brought about
in their works, with the history of criticism proper, there
is no doubt of such a connection in the case of the work—fortunately
in fairly large measure preserved—of Aristophanes,
and with that—unfortunately lost, except in fragments—of his
fellows.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor can there be very much doubt that, though our possessions
might be greater in volume, we could hardly have anything
better in kind than the work of Aristophanes, and especially
the famous play of the <cite>Frogs</cite>, which was probably the earliest of
all the masterpieces of hostile literary criticism, and which
remains to this day among the very finest of them. Aristophanes
indeed united, both generally and in this particular instance, all
the requisites for playing the part to perfection, with one single exception—the
possession, namely, of that wide comparative knowledge
of other literatures which the Greeks lacked, and which,
in this as in other matters, was their most serious deficiency.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>His own literary faculty was of the most exquisite as well as of
the most vigorous kind. His possession, not merely of wit but
of humour in the highest degree, saved him from one of the commonest
and the greatest dangers of criticism—the danger of
dwelling too long on single points, or of giving disproportionate
attention to the different points with which he dealt. And
though no doubt the making a dead-set at bad or faulty literature,
not because it is bad or faulty, but because it happens to
be made the vehicle of views in politics, religion, or what not
which the critic dislikes, is not theoretically defensible; yet the
historian and the practical philosopher must admit that, as a
matter of fact, it has given us some of the very best criticism we
have.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor has it given us anything much better than the <cite>Frogs</cite>.
That the polemic against Euripides, here and elsewhere, is unfairly
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Frogs.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and excessively personal, is not to be denied;
and even those who almost wholly agree with it
from the literary side may grant that it admits, here and there,
of an answer. But still as criticism it is both <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>magnifique</i></span> and
also <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>la guerre</i></span>. The critic is no desultory snarler, unprovided
with theory, and simply snapping at the heels of some one he
dislikes. His twenty years' campaign against the author of the
<cite>Medea</cite>, from the <cite>Acharnians</cite> to the <cite>Frogs</cite> itself, is thoroughly
consistent: it rests upon a reasoned view of art and taste as
well as of politics and religion. He disapproves the sceptical
purpose, the insidious sophistic, the morbid passion of his
victim; but he disapproves quite as strongly the tedious
preliminary explanations and interpolated narratives, the
“precious” sentiment and style, the tricks and the trivialities.
And let it be observed also that Aristophanes, fanatic as he is,
and rightly is, on the Æschylean side, is far too good a critic
and far too shrewd a man not to allow a pretty full view of
the Æschylean defects, as well as to put in the mouth of
Euripides himself a very fairly strong defence of his own
merits. The famous debate between the two poets, with the
accompanying observations of Dionysus and the Chorus, could
be thrown, with the least possible difficulty, into the form of a
critical <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>causerie</i></span> which would anticipate by two thousand years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and more the very shrewdest work of Dryden, the most
thoughtful of Coleridge, the most delicate and ingenious of
Arnold and Sainte-Beuve. It is indeed rather remarkable how
easily literary criticism lends itself to the dramatic-poetical
form, whether the ease be owing to the fact of this early and
consummate example of it, or to some other cause. And what
is especially noticeable is that, throughout, the censure goes
documents in hand. The vague generalities of the <cite>Poetics</cite> in
verse, in which, after Horace and Vida, the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries delighted, are here eschewed in favour of
direct criticism of actual texts. One might call the <cite>Frogs</cite>,
borrowing the phrase from mediæval French, a review <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par
personnages</i></span>, and a review of the closest, the most stringent, and
the most effective. We can indeed only be surprised that with
such an example as this, and others not far inferior, in the same
dramatist if not in others, formal criticism in prose should
have been so long in making its appearance, and when it
appeared, should have shown so much less mastery of method.
Beside Aristophanes, the pure critical reviewing of Aristotle
himself is vague, is desultory, and begins at the wrong end;
even that of Longinus is scrappy and lacking in grasp;
while it would be as unfair as it would be unkind to mention,
in any comparison of genius with the author of the <cite>Frogs</cite>,
the one master of something like formal critical examination
of particular books and authors that Greek preserves for us in
Dionysius of Halicarnassus.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is, however, extremely rash to conclude, as has sometimes
been concluded, that because we find so much tendency towards
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Other criticism in Comedy.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
literary criticism in Aristophanes, we should find a
proportionate amount in other Comic writers (at
least in those of the Old Comedy, who had perhaps
most genius and certainly most <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>parrhesia</i></span>), if their works existed.
The contrary opinion is far more probable. For though we
have nothing but fragments, often insignificant in individual
bulk, of the writers of the Old Comedy except Aristophanes,
and of all the writers of the Middle—nothing but fragments,
though sometimes not insufficient in bulk, of Menander, Philemon,
and the other writers of the New—yet it must be remembered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>that these fragments are extremely numerous, and
that in a very considerable number of cases, fragments as they
are, they give a fair glimpse of context and general tone. I do
not hesitate to say, after most careful examination of the collections
of Meineke and his successors, that there are not more
than one or two faint and doubtful approaches to our subject
discoverable there. The passage of Pherecrates<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c008'><sup>[27]</sup></a> on which M.
Egger chiefly relies to prove his very wide assertion that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“il
n’y a peut-être pas un seul poète”</span> of the Old Comedy <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“qui n’ait
mêlé la critique littéraire à ses fictions comiques”</span> deals with
music, not literature. And it is exceedingly rash to argue from
titles, which, as we know from those of the plays remaining to
us in their entirety, bore as little necessary relation to contents
in ancient as in modern times.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be pleaded, of course, that our comic fragments are
very mainly preserved to us by grammarians, scholiasts, and
lexicographers, who were more likely to find the unusual locutions
for which they principally looked in those descriptions
of the fishmarket and the stews, of which we have so many,
than in literary disquisitions. But in these myriads of fragments,
motelike as they often are, it is contrary to probability
that we should not find at least a respectable proportion of
allusions to any subject which was frequently treated by the
comic writers, just as we do find references not merely to fish
and the hetæræ, but to philosophy (such references are common
enough), to cookery, politics, dress, and all manner of things
except literary criticism. Parodies of serious pieces there may
have been; but parody, though akin to criticism, is earlier,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c008'><sup>[28]</sup></a> and
is rather criticism in the rough. And it is probable, or rather
certain, that the example of the greatest of Comic poets was
followed by the smaller fry in attacks on Euripides; but these
attacks need not have been purely literary at all. The contrast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>between comedy and tragedy attributed to Antiphanes<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c008'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
in his <cite>Poiesis</cite> bears solely on the subject, and the necessity of
greater inventiveness on the part of the comic poet.</p>

<p class='c001'>Once only, so far as I have been able to discover, do we
come upon a passage which (if it be genuine, of which there
<span class='sni side3'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Simylus</i> (?).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
seems to be doubt for more than one reason) has
undoubted right to rank. This is the extremely, the
almost suspiciously, remarkable passage attributed to the
Middle Comic poet, Simylus, by Stobæus, who, be it remembered,
can hardly have lived less than eight or nine hundred
years later. This advances not only a theory of poetry and
poetical criticism, but one of such astonishing completeness
that it goes far beyond anything that we find in Aristotle, and
is worthy of Longinus himself at his very happiest moment,
while it is more complete than anything actually extant in the
Περὶ Ὕψους. It runs as follows:<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c008'><sup>[30]</sup></a> “Neither is nature without
art sufficient to any one for any practical achievement, nor is
art which has not nature with it. When both come together
there are still needed a <i>choragia</i>,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c008'><sup>[31]</sup></a> love of the task, practice, a
lucky occasion, time, a <em>critic able to grasp what is said</em>. If
any of these chance to be missing, a man will not come to
the goal set before him. Natural gifts, good will, painstaking
method—this is what makes wise and good poets. Number of
years makes neither, but only makes them old.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>It would be impossible to put the matter better after more
than two thousand years of literary accumulation and critical
experiment. But it is very hard to believe that it was said in
the fourth century before Christ. The wits, indeed, are rather
those of that period than of a later; but the experience is that
of a careful comparer of more than one literature. In other
words, it is the voice of Aristotle speaking with the experience
of Quintilian. And it stands, let me repeat, so far as
I have been able to discover, absolutely alone in the extant
representation of the department of literature to which it
is attributed.</p>

<p class='c001'>To pass from Aristophanes and Plato to Isocrates is to pass
from persons of the first rank in literature to a person not of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Isocrates.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the first rank. Yet for our purpose the “old man
eloquent” is not to be despised. On the contrary,
he even has special and particular value. For the worst—as
no doubt also the best—of men like Aristophanes and Plato
is, that they are too little of their time and too much for all
time. Moreover, in Isocrates we come not merely to a man
above the common, though not reaching the summits of wit,
but also to something like a “professional”—to some one who,
to some extent, supplies the loss of the earlier professionals
already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c001'>To some extent only: for Isocrates, at least in so far as we
possess his work, is a rhetorician on the applied sides, which
commended themselves so especially to the Greeks, not on the
pure side. The legend of his death, at least, fits the political
interests of his life; his rhetoric is mostly judicial rhetoric;
little as he is of a philosopher, he attacks the sophists as
philosophers were in duty bound to do. His purely literary
allusions (and they are little more) have a touch of that
amusing, that slightly irritating, that wholly important and
characteristic patronage and disdain which meets us throughout
this period. He was at least believed to have written a
formal <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, but it is doubtful whether we should find much
purely literary criticism in it if we had it. His own style, if
not exactly gaudy, is pretentious and artificial: we can hardly
say that the somewhat vaguely favourable prophecy which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Plato puts into the mouth of Socrates about him at the end of
the <cite>Phædrus</cite> was very conspicuously fulfilled. And his critical
impulses cannot have been very imperative, seeing that though
he lived till nearly a hundred, he never found the “happy
moment”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c008'><sup>[32]</sup></a> to write about poetry spoken of in the 12th section
of the Panathenaic with a scornful reference to those who
“rhapsodised and chattered” in the Lyceum about Homer and
Hesiod and other poets. Most of his actual literary references
are, as usual, ethical, not literary. In the 12th and 13th
section of the oration-epistle to Nicocles<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c008'><sup>[33]</sup></a> he upbraids mankind
for praising Hesiod and Theognis and Phocylides as admirable
counsellors in life, but preferring to hear the most trumpery of
comedies; and himself declares Homer<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c008'><sup>[34]</sup></a> and the great tragic
masters worthy of admiration because of their mastery of
human nature. In the <cite>Busiris</cite><a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c008'><sup>[35]</sup></a> he takes quite a Platonic tone
about the blasphemies of poets against the gods. There is,
indeed, a curious and interesting passage in the <cite>Evagoras</cite><a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c008'><sup>[36]</sup></a> about
the difficulties of panegyric in prose, and the advantages
possessed by verse-writers. They have greater liberty of
handling their subject; they may use new words and foreign
words and metaphors; they can bewitch the soul with rhythm
and metre till even bad diction and thought pass unnoticed. For
if (says the rhetor naïvely enough) you leave the most celebrated
poets their words and meaning, but strip them of their
metre, they will cut a much shabbier figure than they do now.
But this does not take us very far, and with Isocrates we get
no further.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor need we expect to get any further. Criticism, in any
full and fertile sense of the word, implies in all cases a considerable
body of existing literature, in almost all cases the
possibility of comparing literatures in different languages. The
Greeks were but accumulating (though accumulating with
marvellous rapidity) the one; they had as yet no opportunity
of the other, and it must be confessed that they did not welcome
the opportunity with any eagerness when it came. All the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>more glory to them that, when as yet the accumulation was but
proceeding, they produced such work in the kind as that of
Plato and Aristophanes; that at the first halt they made such
astonishing, if in some ways such necessarily incomplete, use of
what had been accumulated, as in the next chapter we shall see
was made by Aristotle.</p>

His page in Bergk (iii. 379) is blank,
except for the phrase which Plato himself
quotes: εὕρημά τι Μοισᾶν—“a
windfall of the Muses.” Of a very
commonplace distich about Agamemnon’s

apparently relieve him.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. If the space and treatment here
allotted to Plato seem exceeding poor
and beggarly, it can but be urged that
his own criticism of literature is so
exceedingly <em>general</em> that in this book
no other treatment of it was possible.
On his own principles we should be
“praising the horse in terms of the
ass” if we did otherwise. It is true
that besides the <em>attitude</em> above extolled,
there are to be found, from
the glancing, many-sided, parabolic
discourse of the <cite>Phædrus</cite> to the
mighty theory of the <cite>Republic</cite>, endless
things invaluable, nay, indispensable,
to the critic. It is nearly certain
that, as Professor Butcher thinks, no
one had anticipated him in the recognition
of the organic unity necessary
to a work of literary, as of all,
art. But even here, as in the messages
“to Lysias and all others who write
orations, to Homer and all others who
write poems, to Solon, &amp;c.,” we see the
generality, the abstraction, the evasiveness,
one may almost say, of his critical
gospel. Such concrete things as the
reference to Isocrates at the end of the
<i>Phædrus</i> are very rare; and, on the
other hand, his frequent and full
dealings with Homer are not literary
criticism at all. In a treatise on
Æsthetics Plato cannot have too large
a space; in a History of Criticism the
place allotted to him must be conspicuous,
but the space small.</p>

<p class='c007'>The uncomfortable conditions which have prevailed during
the examination of Greek criticism during the Pre-Aristotelian
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Authorship of the criticism attributed to Aristotle.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
age disappear almost entirely when we come to
Aristotle himself. Hitherto we have had either
no texts at all, mere fragments and titles, or else
documents fairly voluminous and infinitely interesting
as literature, but as criticism indirect, accidental, and
destitute of professional and methodical character. With the
<cite>Rhetoric</cite> and the <cite>Poetics</cite> in our hands, no such complaints are
any longer possible. It is true that in both cases certain other
drawbacks, already glanced at, still exist, and that the <cite>Poetics</cite>,
if not the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, is obviously incomplete. But both, and
especially the shorter and more fragmentary book, give us so
much that it is almost unreasonable to demand more—nay, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>we can very fairly, and with no rashness, divine what the
“more” would have been like if we had it. In these two
books the characteristics of Greek criticism, such as it was and
such as probably in any case it must have been, are revealed as
clearly as by a whole library.</p>

<p class='c001'>In dealing with them we are happily, here as elsewhere, freed
from a troublesome preliminary examination as to genuineness.
There is no reasonable doubt on this head as far as the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>
goes, and I should myself be disposed to say that there is no
reasonable doubt as to the <cite>Poetics</cite>, but others have thought
differently. It so happens, however, that for our special purpose
it really does not matter so very much whether the book
is genuine or not. For it can hardly by any possibility be
much later than Aristotle, and that being so it gives us what
we want—the critical views of Greek literature when the first
great age of that literature was pretty well closed. It is by
Aristotle, probably, by X or Z possibly, but in any case by a
man of wide knowledge, clear intellect, and methodical habits.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before we examine in detail what these views were, let us
clearly understand what was the literature which this person
(whom in both cases we shall call, and who in both pretty certainly
was, Aristotle) had before him. The bulk of it was in
verse, and though unfortunately a large proportion of that bulk
is now lost, we have specimens, and (it would seem) many, if not
most, of the best specimens, of all its kinds. Of a great body of
epic or quasi-epic verse, only Homer and Hesiod survive; but
Homer was admittedly the greatest epic, and Hesiod the greatest
didactic, poet of this class. In the course of less than a
century an enormous body of tragic drama had been accumulated,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its subject-matter.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
by far the greatest part of which has perished;
but we possess ample specimens of the (admittedly)
first Three in this kind also. Of the great old comic dramatists,
Aristophanes survives alone—a mere volume, so to speak, of
the library which Aristotle had before him: yet it is pretty
certain that if we had it all, the quantity rather than the degree
and kind of literary pleasure given by the series from the
<cite>Acharnians</cite> to the <cite>Plutus</cite> would be increased. We are worst off
in regard to lyric: it is here that Aristotle has the greatest advantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>over his modern readers. Yet, by accident or not (it
may be strongly suspected <em>not</em>), it is the advantage of which he
avails himself least. On the other hand, some kinds—the
pastoral, the very miscellaneous kind called epigram, and
others—were scarcely yet full grown; and, much of them as is
lost, we have more advantage of him.</p>

<p class='c001'>In prose he had (or at least so it would seem likely) a lesser
bulk of material, and what he had was subject to a curious
condition, of which more hereafter. But he had nearly all the
best things that we have—Plato and Xenophon, Herodotus and
Thucydides, all the greatest of the orators. Here, however,
his date again subjected him to disadvantages, the greatest of
which—one felt in every page of the <cite>Poetics</cite>, and not insensible
in the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>—was the absence, entire or all but entire, of any
body of prose fiction. The existence, the date, the subjects, the
very verse or prose character of the “Milesian tales,” so often
talked of, are all shadows of shades, and whatever they were,
Aristotle takes no count of them. It seems to be with him a
matter of course that “fiction” and “poetry” are coextensive
and synonymous.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c008'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of the enormous and, to speak frankly at once, the very disastrous,
influence which this limitation of his subject-matter
has on him, it will be time to speak fully later. Let us first
see what this famous little treatise<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c008'><sup>[38]</sup></a>—than which perhaps
no other document in the world, not religious or political,
has been the occasion of fuller discussion—does actually
contain.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>He first defines his scheme as dealing with poetry itself
and its various kinds, with their essential parts, with the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Abstract of the</i> Poetics.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
structure of the plot, the number and nature of
the parts, and the rest of poetic method. Then
he lays it down that Epic, Tragedy, Comedy, Dithyrambic,
as well as <i>auletice</i> and <i>kitharistice</i> generally, are <em>mimesis</em>—"imitation,"
as it is generally translated—but that they differ
in the medium, the objects, and the manner of that imitation.
And after glancing at music and dancing as non-literary
mimetic arts, he turns to the art which imitates by language
alone. Here he meets a difficulty: there is, he thinks, no
common name which will suit the mimes of Sophron and
Xenarchus, the “Socratic dialogues,” and iambic or elegiac
<em>mimesis</em>. He objects strongly to the idea that metre makes
the poet, and produces instances, among which the most striking
is his refusal of the name poet to Empedocles. Having
disposed of the <em>medium</em>—rhythm, metre, &amp;c.—he turns to the
objects. Here he has no doubt: the <em>objects</em> of mimesis are men
in action, and we must represent them as “better than life”
(heroic or idealising representation), as they are (realistic), or
worse (caricature or satire). The <em>manner</em> does not seem to
suggest to him much greater diversity than that of epic (or
direct narrative), and dramatic, as to the latter of which he
has a slight historical excursus.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he philosophises. Poetry, he says, has two causes: one
the instinct of imitation, with the pleasure attached to it;
the other, the instinct for harmony. And then he again becomes
historical, and reviews briefly Homer, Æschylus, Sophocles,
and the progress of poetry under them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Comedy he dismisses very briefly. He thinks that it ἔλαθε
διὰ τὸ μὴ σπουδάζεσθαι—little attention was paid to it, as
not being taken seriously. Epic and tragedy must be treated
first—tragedy first of all. And then he plunges straight into
the famous definition of tragedy, discussion of which had best
be reserved. The definition itself is this: “An imitation of an
action, serious, complete, and possessing magnitude, in language
sweetened with each kind of sweetening in the several parts,
conveyed by action and not recital, possessing pity and terror,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>accomplishing the purgation of such<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c008'><sup>[39]</sup></a> emotions.” Tragedy will
require scenic arrangements, musical accompaniments, and
“words,” as modern actors say; his own term, “lexis,” is not
so very different. But it will also require character, “thought,”
and plot or story. The most important of all is the last, which
he also describes by another name, the “setting together of
incidents,” the Action—to which he thinks character quite
subsidiary, and indeed facultative. There cannot, he says categorically,
be tragedy without action; there may be without
character. “The most powerful elements of emotional interest,”
as Professor Butcher translates οἷς ψυχαγωγεῖ, “the
things with which tragedy leads souls,” are revolutions and
discoveries, and these are parts of action. Novices can do good
things in diction and in character, not in plot. Still Character
is second. Thought is third, Diction apparently a bad fourth.
Song is only a chief embellishment or “sweetening,” and Scenery
is the last of all, because, though influencing the soul, it is
inartistic and outside poetry. So he turns once more as to the
principal or chief thing, to the plot or action. This is to be a
complete whole, and of a certain magnitude, with a beginning,
middle, and end. A very small animal organism<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c008'><sup>[40]</sup></a> cannot be
beautiful, as neither can one “ten thousand stadia long.” Then
he comes to the great question of Unity—or, since that word
is much blurred by usage, let us say “what makes the story
one.” It is not enough to have a single hero; life, even a part
of a life, is too complicated for that. We must have just so
much and just so little that the action shall present neither
gaps nor redundancies. Nor need the poet by any means stick
to historical or prescribed fact—the probable, not the actual,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>is his game. He may invent wholly (subject to this law of
probability) if he likes. Plots with episodes are bad.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have, however, to go further. Not only must the action
of tragedy be complete and probable, but it must deal with
terrible and pitiful things: if these surprise us, so much the
better. After distinguishing between simple plots (without
Revolution and Discovery) or complex (with them), and describing
these two elements at more length, he attacks, in a rather
suspected passage, the Parts—Prologue, Episode, Exodus,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c008'><sup>[41]</sup></a> the
choric part, &amp;c.—and then, preferring the complex scheme,
shows how it is to be managed. The hero must not blamelessly
pass from prosperity to adversity, nor blamefully in the opposite
direction. He must be a person of considerable position, who
by some error or weakness (ἁμαρτία) comes to misfortune. Also
the special kind of pity and terror which is to be employed to
make him interesting, the <i>oikeia hedone</i> of tragedy, is most
important, not a few examples being taken in illustration from
the great tragedians.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then we pass to Character. It must be good—even a woman
is good sometimes—it must be appropriate, true to life, and consistent.
Probability is here as important as in Action; the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Deus ex machina</i></span> is to be used with extreme caution. After
turning to the details of Discovery, and dealing with Gesture,
Scene, &amp;c., he goes to the two main stages of Tragedy, <i>desis</i> and
<i>lusis</i>, Twisting and Unravelling, and to its four kinds (an extension
of his former classification)—Simple, Complex, Pathetic,
and Ethical. And the tragic poet is especially warned against
Tragedy with an Epic structure—that is to say, a variety of
plots. The Chorus must bear part in the action, and not give
mere interludes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thought” is somewhat briefly referred to Rhetoric (<i>vide
infra</i>), and then we come to Diction. This is treated rather
oddly, though the oddity will not seem so odd to those who
have carefully studied the contents, still more the texts, of the
foregoing chapter. Much of the handling is purely grammatical.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>The “Figures,” especially metaphor, make some appearance: and
of style proper we hear little more than that it is to be clear
without being mean, though we have some illuminative examples
of this difference.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Aristotle passes briefly to Epic, his prescription for
which is an application of that already given—the single action,
with its beginning, middle, and end. The organism, with its
<i>oikeia hedone</i>, the parts, the kinds are the same, with the
exception of song and scenery. The only differences are scale (Epic
being much larger) and metre, with a fuller allowance for the
improbable, the irrational. Some rather desultory remarks on
difficulties of criticism or interpretation follow, and the piece
ends abruptly with a consideration of the purely academic
question whether Epic or Tragedy ranks higher. Some had
given the primacy to Epic: Aristotle votes for Tragedy, and
gives his reasons.</p>

<p class='c001'>This summary has been cut down purposely to the lowest
point consistent with sufficiency and clearness; but I trust it
is neither insufficient nor obscure. We may now see what can
be observed in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>We observe, in the first place, not merely a far fuller dose of
criticism than in anything studied hitherto, but also a great
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Characteristics, general.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
advance of critical <em>theory</em>. Not only has the writer
got beyond the obscure, fragmentary, often irrelevant,
utterances of the early philosophers: but he is neither conducting
a particular polemic, as was Aristophanes, nor speaking to
the previous question, like Plato. An <i>a posteriori</i> proof of the
depth and solidity of the inquiry may be found in the fact that
it is still, after more than two thousand years, hardly in the least
obsolete. But we are not driven to this: its intrinsic merit is
quite sufficient.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time, there are certain defects and drawbacks in
it which are of almost as much importance as its merits, and
which perhaps require prior treatment. That it is incomplete
admits of no doubt; that part of it shows signs of corruption,
that there are possible garblings and spurious insertions, does
not admit of very much. But the view throughout is so firm
and consistent; the incidental remarks tally so well with what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>we should expect; and, above all, the exclusions or belittlings
are so significant, that if the treatise were very much more complete,
it would probably not tell us very much more than we
know or can reasonably infer already.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, we can see, partly as a merit and partly as
a drawback, that Aristotle has not merely confined himself with
philosophical exactness to the Greek literature actually before
him, but has committed the not unnatural, though unfortunate,
mistake of taking that literature as if it were final and
exhaustive. He generalises from his materials, especially from
Homer and the three Tragedians, as if they provided not merely
admirable examples of poetic art, but a Catholic body of literary
practice to go outside of which were sin. It is impossible not
to feel, at every moment, that had he had the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Divina Commedia</cite></span>
and Shakespeare side by side with the <cite>Iliad</cite> and Æschylus, his
views as to both Epic and Tragedy might have been modified
in the most important manner. And I at least find it still
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Limitations of range.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
more impossible not to be certain that if there had
been a Greek Scott or a Greek Thackeray, a Greek
Dumas or a Greek Balzac before him, his views as to the constitutive
part of poetry being not subjective form but “imitative”
substance would have undergone such a modification that
they might even have contradicted these now expressed. If
tragedy, partly from its religious connection, partly from its
overwhelming vogue, but most of all from the flood of genius
which had been poured into the form for two or three generations
past, had not occupied the position which it did occupy
in fact, it would probably not have held anything like its
present place in the <cite>Poetics</cite>. And so in other ways. It may be
consciously, it may be unconsciously, Aristotle took the Greek,
and especially the Attic, literature, which constituted his
library, and treated this as if it were all literature. What
he has executed is in reality an induction from certain notable
but by no means all-embracing phenomena; it has too much
of the appearance, and has too often been taken as having
more than the appearance, of being an authoritative and
inclusive description of what universally is, and universally
ought to be.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>We have also to take into account the Greek fancy for
generalising and philosophising, especially with a strong ethical
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ethical twist.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
preoccupation. Aristotle does not show this in the
fantastic directions of the earlier allegorising critics,
but he is doubly and trebly ethical. He has none of the
Platonic doubts about Imitation as being a bad thing in itself,
but he is quite as rigid in his prescription of good subjects.
Although we have no full treatment of Comedy, his distaste—almost
his contempt—for it is clear; and debatable as the
famous “pity and terror” clause of the definition of tragedy
may be, its ethical drift is unmistakable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus his criticism, consciously or unconsciously, is warped
and twisted by two unnecessary controlments. On the one
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Drawbacks resulting.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
hand, he looks too much at the actual occupants of
his bookcase, without considering whether there may
not be another bookcase filled with other things, as good but
different. On the other, he is too prone, not merely to generalise
from his facts as if they were the only possible facts, but to
“overstep the genus” a little in his generalisation, and to merge
Poetics in Ethics. That others went further than he did, that
they said later that a hero must not only be good but white,
and superadded to his Unity of Action a Unity of Time and
a Unity of Place, which his documents do not admit, and which
his doctrines by no means justify, are matters for which, no
doubt, he is not to be blamed. But of the things for which he
is legitimately responsible, some are not quite praiseworthy.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, “Imitation” is an awkward word, though
no doubt it is more awkward in the English than in the Greek,
and “Representation” or “Fiction” will get us out of part of
the difficulty. Not only does this term for the secondary creation
proper to art belittle it too much, but it suggests awkward
and mischievous limitations: it ties the poet’s hands and circumscribes
his aims.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c008'><sup>[42]</sup></a> Indirectly it is perhaps responsible for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Aristotle’s worst critical slip—his depreciation of Character in
comparison with Action. This very depreciation is, however,
a serious shortcoming; and so is the failure to recognise, despite
some not indistinct examples of it in the matter before him
from the <cite>Odyssey</cite> downwards, what has been called “Romantic
Unity,” that is to say, the Unity given by Character itself,
though the action may be linear and progressive rather than
by way of <i>desis</i> and <i>lusis</i>. The attempt to extend (save in respect
of scale only) the limitations of Tragedy to Epic is
another fault; and so perhaps is the great complexity and the
at least not inconsiderable obscurity of the definition of Tragedy
itself. In such a treatise as this it is possible merely to
allude to the famous clause, “through pity and terror effecting
the <i>katharsis</i> of such emotions.” Volumes have been written
on these few words,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c008'><sup>[43]</sup></a> the chief crux being, of course, the word
<i>katharsis</i>. It cannot be said that any of the numerous solutions
is by itself and to demonstration correct, but it is clear that
the addition is out of keeping with the rest of the definition.
Hitherto Aristotle, whether we agree with him or not, has been
purely literary, but he now shifts to ethics. You might almost
as well define fire in terms strictly appropriate to physics, and
then add, “effecting the cooking of sirloins in a manner suitable
to such objects.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet the advantages of this criticism far exceed its drawbacks.
In the first place it is, not merely so far as we positively know,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Overbalance of merit.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but by all legitimate inference, the earliest formal
treatise on the art in European literature. In the
second place, even if it sticks rather too close to its individual
subject, that individual subject was, as it happens, so marvellously
rich and perfect that no such great harm is done.
A man will always be handicapped by attempting to base
criticism on a single literature, yet he who knows Greek only
will be in far better case than he who only knows any one
other, except in so far as the knowledge of any later literature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>inevitably conveys an indirect dose of knowledge of
Greek.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, too, Aristotle’s use of his material is quite astonishingly
judicious. In almost every single instance we might
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The doctrine of</i> ἁμαρτία.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
expect his limitations to do him more harm than
they have done. He might, for instance, with far more
excuse than Wordsworth, have fallen into Wordsworth’s error
of considering metre not merely as not essential to poetry, but
as only accidentally connected with it. And it is also extremely
remarkable how little, on the whole, his ethical preoccupation
carries him away. He exhibits it; but it does not blind him
(as it had blinded even Plato) to the fact that the special end
of Art is pleasure, that the perfection of literature is not an
end in itself but a means to an end. Even more surprising is
the acuteness, the sufficiency, and the far-reaching character of
his doctrine of the Tragic ἁμαρτία. For there can be no question
that he has here hit on the real differentia of tragedy—a
differentia existing as well in the tragedy of Character, which
he rather pooh-poohs, and in the Romantic tragedy which he
did not know, and on his actual principles was bound to disapprove
if he had known it, as in the Classical. Shakespeare
joins hands with Æschylus (and both stand thus more sharply
contrasted with inferior tragedians than in any other point) in
making their chief tragic engine “the pity of it,” the sense that
there is infinite excuse, but no positive justification, for the acts
which bring their heroes and heroines to misfortune. Wherever
the tragedian, of whatever style and time, has hit this ἁμαρτία,
this human and not disgusting “fault,” he has triumphed; wherever
he has missed it, he has failed, in proportion to the breadth
of his miss.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to the minor and verbal points of the <cite>Poetics</cite>
there is less to say, because there is very much less of them:
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Rhetoric.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and what there is to say had better be said when
we have considered the contents of the other great
critical book, the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, which may be taken as holding, if
not intentionally yet actually, something of the same position
towards Prose as that which the <cite>Poetics</cite> holds towards verse.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Before giving an analysis of this book,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c008'><sup>[44]</sup></a> to match that given
above of the <cite>Poetics</cite>, a few words may properly be said to justify
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Meaning and range of “Rhetoric.”</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
what may seen to be the rather arbitrary proceeding
of, on the one hand, attaching to Rhetoric a
sense avowedly somewhat different from Aristotle’s,
and on the other dropping consideration of the major part of
what he has actually written in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a mistake to force too much the bare meanings of words;
but I suppose one may, without much danger of controversy,
take the bare meaning of Rhetoric to be “speechcraft.” Now,
it is not difficult to prove that, in Aristotle’s time, speechcraft
practically included the whole of prose literature, if not the
whole of literature. Poems were recited; histories were read
out; the entire course of scientific and philosophic education
and study went on by lecture or by dialogue. Nay, it is perhaps
not fanciful to point out that the very words for reading,
ἀναγιγνώσκω and ἐπιλέγομαι seem to represent it as at best a
secondary and parasitic process, a “going over again” of something
previously said and heard.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c008'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Yet though this is an important point, and has been rather
too commonly overlooked, it is no doubt inferior in gravity
to the universally recognised fact that the importance of speechcraft
proper, of oratory, was in Greece such as it is now only
possible dimly to realise. Every public and private right of
the citizen depended upon his power to speak or the power
of somebody else to speak for him; a tongue-tied person not
only had no chance of rising in the State, but was liable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>be insulted, and plundered, and outraged in every way. To
some it has seemed that the great and almost fatal drawback to
that Athenian life, which in not a few ways was life in a sort of
Earthly Paradise, was the incessant necessity of either talking
or being talked to. It was therefore not in the least wonderful
that the first efforts—those of the Sicilian sophists (or others)—to
reduce to something like theory the art of composition, of
arranging words effectively, should be directed to <em>spoken</em> words,
and to spoken words more particularly under the all-important
conditions of the public meeting and the law court—by no
means neglecting the art of persuasion, as practicable in the
Porch, or the Garden, or the private supper-room. That prose
literature—that all literature—has for its object to give pleasure
dawned later upon men. Aristotle and persons much earlier than
Aristotle—Corax and Tisias themselves—would probably have
acknowledged that prose, like poetry, ought to please, but only
as a further means to a further end, persuasion. Its object
was to make men <em>do</em> something—pass or negative such a law,
bring in such a verdict, appoint such an officer, or (in the minor
cases) believe or disbelieve such a tenet, adopt or shun such a
course of conduct. Even in poetry, as we have seen, the ethical
preoccupation partly obscured the clear æsthetic doctrine—you
were to be purged as well as pleased, and pleased in order
that you might be purged. But in prose the pleasure became
still more subsidiary, ancillary, facultative. You were first
of all to be “persuaded.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, if this be taken as granted, and if, further, we keep
in mind Aristotle’s habit of sticking to the facts before him, we
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The contents of the book.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
shall not be in the least surprised to find that the
<cite>Rhetoric</cite> contains a great deal of matter which has
either the faintest connection with literary criticism, or else
no connection with it at all. It is true that of the three subjects
which the <cite>Rhetoric</cite> treats, <i>pistis</i> (means of persuasion),
<i>lexis</i> (style), and <i>taxis</i> (arrangement), the second belongs wholly
and the third very mainly to our subject, while it would be
by no means impossible for an ingenious arguer to make good
the position that <i>pistis</i>, with no extraordinary violence of transition,
may be laid at least under contribution for that <em>attractive</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>quality which all literature as a pleasure-giving art must have.
But in actual handling <cite>Pistis</cite> has two out of the three books, and
is treated, as a rule, from a point of view which leaves matters
purely literary out of consideration altogether—"The Characteristics
of Audiences," “The Colours of Good and Evil,” “The
Passions as likely to exist in an Audience,” “The Material of
Enthymeme” (the special rhetorical syllogism), and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Only in the third book (which, by the way, is shorter than
either of the other two) do we get beyond these counsels to
the advocate and the public speaker, into the Higher Rhetoric
which concerns all prose literature and even some poetry.
And even then we meet with a sort of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>douche</i></span> of cold water
which may not a little dash those who have not given careful
heed to the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p class='c001'>Inquiry into the sources and means of persuasion (our
author admits graciously, but with a touch of superiority which,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Attitude to</i> lexis.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as we shall see, accentuates itself later) does not
quite exhaust Rhetoric. It must also discuss style
and arrangement. But style is a modern thing, and, rightly
considered, something <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad captandum</i></span>.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c008'><sup>[46]</sup></a> Indeed Aristotle never
seems to keep it quite clear from mere elocution or delivery—from
the art of the actor as contradistinguished from that
of the writer. He remarks that he has dealt with style fully
in his <cite>Poetics</cite>; and as he has certainly not done so in the
<cite>Poetics</cite> which we have, this is an argument that they are
incomplete, though by no means that they are spurious. But
it is almost impossible to mistake the touch of patronage, not to
say of scorn, with which he deals with it here, and we need not
doubt that, if we had the other handling to which he refers,
something of the same sort would appear there. The fact is,
that the Greeks of this period were what we may call High-fliers;
anything that had the appearance of being “mechanical,”
anything that seemed to subject the things of the spirit to
something not wholly of the spirit, they regarded with suspicion
and impatience, which rather suggests the objection of some
theologians to good works. Words, like colours, materials
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>of sculpture and architecture, and the like, were “filthy rags”;
and if Aristotle’s common-sense carried him a little less far
in this direction than his master Plato’s philosophical enthusiasm,
it certainly carried him some way.</p>

<p class='c001'>This same common-sense, however, seldom deserted him, and
it makes sometimes wholly for good, sometimes a little less
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Vocabulary—"Figures".</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
so, throughout the treatise. At the very outset he
commits himself to that definition of style as being
first of all <em>clear</em>—as giving the meaning of the writer—which
has so often captivated noble wits down to Coleridge’s time, and
even since, but which yet is clearly wrong, for “two and two
make four” is the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a per se</i></span> of clearness, and there is uncommonly
little style in it notwithstanding. That he himself saw this
objection cannot be doubted, for he hastens to add<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c008'><sup>[47]</sup></a> that it must
be not only clear, but neither too low nor too far above the
subject, thus producing a useful and perfectly just distinction
between the styles of poetry and prose. And then he gives us,
as he had done in the <cite>Poetics</cite>, one of those distinctions of his
which are so valuable—the distinction of vocabulary into what
is κύριον or current (which conduces to clearness), and what is
ξένον or unfamiliar (which conduces to elevation). Let us
note that this, like the ἁμαρτία theory in the <cite>Poetics</cite>, is one
of Aristotle’s great critical achievements. But the note of
greatness may perhaps be discovered less in the attention
which from this point he begins to pay to Metaphor. Not
of course that metaphor is not a very important thing; but
that the example of ticking it off in this fashion with a name
spread rapidly in Rhetoric, and became a mere nuisance. Even
Quintilian, who spoke words of wit and sense about the Greek
mania for baptising new Figures, submitted to them to some
extent: and any one who wishes to appreciate the need of
Butler’s jest to the effect that</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>has no farther to look than to the portentous list at the end of
Puttenham’s <cite>Art of Poetry</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet his cautions as to metaphors themselves, which he
regards as the chief means of embellishment in prose, are
perfectly just and sound. They must, he says, be selected with
careful reference to the particular effect intended to be produced,
be euphonious, not far-fetched, and drawn from beautiful
objects.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, perhaps as well as in reference to any single passage
in the <cite>Poetics</cite>, we have an opportunity of considering for the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>A difficulty.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
first time a difficulty, not unexpected, not uninteresting,
which meets us, and which will recur frequently,
in ancient (and sometimes in the most modern) criticism. It is
the difficulty which so did please Locke and his followers in the
attack on the doctrine of Innate Ideas,—in other words, the
difficulty of an apparently hopeless difference of standard on
points of taste—the difference between Greek and modern love,
between English and Hottentot beauty. One should, says the
philosopher, say ῥοδοδάκτυλος rather than φοινικοδάκτυλος,
while ἐρυθροδάκτυλος is the worst of all. The commentators
have tried to get out of the difficulty by suggesting that the last
suggests the redness of frost-bitten or domestically disfigured
fingers. φοινικοδάκτυλος would in the same way, I suppose, be
considered as objectionable because the colour is overcharged
in the epithet, and might even suggest “red-handed” in the
sense of “bloodstained.” Yet one may doubt whether Aristotle’s
objection is based on anything but the fact that Homer uses the
one epithet, not the others. The verb ἐρυθριάω, at any rate, is
invariably used for blushing, not an unattractive or unbeautiful
proceeding by any means. And we shall find very much stronger
instances of this difficulty later.</p>

<p class='c001'>The explanation is partly supplied by the very next section,
which deals with ψυχρότης and is one of the most valuable
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Frigidity.</i>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
keys existing to the whole tone of Greek, indeed
of classical, criticism. It  is rather unlucky that
“frigidity,” our only equivalent, is not quite clear to English
ears. In fact, “fustian” comes nearest to what is meant, though
it is not completely adequate and coextensive. The idea is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>difficult to follow—it is that of something which is intended to
excite and inflame the auditor or reader, while in fact it leaves
him cold, if it does not actually lower his spiritual temperature.
Aristotle gives four cases, or (which is nearly the same thing)
four kinds of it—words excessively compounded, foreign terms,
too emphatic or minute epithets, and improper metaphors. To
these, as generalities, few would object, but the instances are
sometimes decidedly puzzling. Lycophron (the sophist, not the
poet) is blamed for calling the heavens πολυπρόσωπον (“many-visaged”),
the earth μεγαλοκόρυφον (“mightily mountain-topped”),
and the shore στενοπόρον (“leaving a narrow passage
between cliff and sea”). Now, perhaps these terms are too
poetical, yet we should hardly call them frigid, for they are not
untrue to nature, and they not only show thought and imagination
in the writer, but excite both in the reader. Still, they are
all slightly <em>excessive</em>; they pass measure, as do other things
blamed in Alcidamas and Gorgias still more.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second objection is of still greater interest, because it has
practically supplied a shibboleth in the Classic-Romantic debate
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Archaism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
up to the present moment. It is the objection to
archaic, foreign, and otherwise inusitate words, which
Aristotle seems to apply even to Homeric terms, not as poetic
but as obsolete, just as other good persons in times nearer
our own have applied the same to Chaucerisms and the like.
The sounder doctrine, of course, is that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nullum tempus occurrit
regi</i></span> in this transferred sense also—that what the old kings of
literature have stamped remains current for ever, and what the
new kings of literature stamp takes currency at once.</p>

<p class='c001'>Almost as interesting is the third punishment-cell, in which
epithets too long, too many, or out of place are bestowed. The
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Stock epithet and periphrasis.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
two habits which seem to be mainly aimed at here
(Alcidamas is still the chief awful example) are the
use in prose of the poetical perpetual epithet (“white
milk” is the example chosen) and the undue tendency to periphrasis,
which, curiously enough, reminds one of the besetting
sin of the extreme “Classical” school of the last century.</p>

<p class='c001'>Most puzzling of all are the examples pilloried for impropriety
in the fourth class, the unfortunate Alcidamas being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>rebuked for calling philosophy “the intrenchment of law,” and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>False metaphor.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the Odyssey a “mirror of human life.” The most,
thoroughgoing Aristotelians have given up this last
criticism with an acknowledgment that ancient and modern
tastes differ; while Mr Cope even suggests that Aristotle
“winked,” not nodded, when he wrote the whole passage. I do
not so easily figure to myself a winking Stagirite.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the chapter on Simile which follows there is much that is
sensible, but nothing that is surprising—the relation of simile
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Simile.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and metaphor being the main point. One’s expectations
are more raised in coming to the great subject
of “purity” of style—"Hellenising," “writing Greek.” This
phrase, in our author, is directed against something corresponding
rather to the French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“fautes de Français”</span> than to our “not
English,” having regard to the syntax, the sentence-building,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Purity.</i>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
rather than to the actual diction. But it
differs from both in having, like so much of his criticism, more
to do with  matter  than  form. In  fact, it has  been well
observed that “Perspicuity” rather than “Purity” is really the
subject of the chapter. It is, however, of great importance, and
the next, on Elevation, or Grandeur, or Dignity, is
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Elevation.</i>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of greater still. Some slight difficulty may occur at
starting with the word thus variously rendered in English,
ὄγκος. In its non-rhetorical use, the word (which strictly
means “bulk,” with the added notion of weight) inclines rather
to an unfavourable signification, often signifying “pretentiousness,”
“pomposity”: it is sometimes used later in Rhetoric itself
with such a meaning; and I think those who compare the
earlier passage on Frigidity will be inclined to suspect that
Aristotle himself was not using it entirely <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>honoris causa</i></span>. He
gives, however, some hints for its attainment, and a bundle of
instances, where our ignorance of the context makes the illustrative
power somewhat small.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next we come to that quality of τὸ πρέπον, “the becoming,”
“propriety,” which is commonly and not wrongly taken to be
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Propriety.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the special note of “classical” writing.  And we have
rules for its attainment, some ethical rather than
æsthetic, some æsthetic enough but curiously arbitrary, as that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>unusual words are not appropriate <em>except to</em> a person in a state
of excitement. At the close there is an interesting glance at the
irony of Gorgias and of Socrates.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next division is one of the very <i>apices</i> of the whole. It
deals with that subject of the rhythm of prose which, though
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Prose rhythm.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
(as we see from Quintilian as well as from Aristotle)
never neglected by the ancients, is one of the most
difficult parts of their critical Rhetoric for us to understand, and
(perhaps for that reason) has been, till the last hundred years or
so, strangely neglected in the criticism of modern languages.</p>

<p class='c001'>We see from its very opening words that the great distinctions
between verse and prose literature on the one hand, and
between literary and non-literary composition on the other,
had been already hit upon. Prose style, says he, must be
neither <i>emmetron</i> nor <i>arrhythmon</i>—that is to say, it must not
have metre nor lack rhythm. But he does not very accurately
define the difference between these things; and it cannot be
said that any of his commentators and successors have supplied
this defect, though it is easy enough to do so.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c008'><sup>[48]</sup></a> He, however,
allows feet if not metre in prose, and proceeds to inquire what
feet will do, making observations on the subject which are in
the three degrees of obscurity to all who are not fond of
guessing. Dactylic, iambic, and trochaic rhythms are dismissed
for various reasons, rather bad than good—it not having
apparently struck the critic that all these arrange themselves
too <em>easily</em>, certainly, and definitely into metre. He pitches
finally on the pæan, a foot which, though admissible in those
Greek choric measures which are a sort of compromise between
prose and poetry, at once reveals its suitableness for prose in
modern languages by the fact that it is unsuitable for modern
verse. The pæan or pæon is a tetrasyllabic foot, consisting of
three short syllables and a long one, of which in strictness
there may be four varieties, the long syllable being admissible
in any of the four places. But Aristotle only admits two, with
the long syllable in the first and fourth place respectively.
And here, most tantalisingly, he breaks off.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>The distinction between loose and periodic style,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c008'><sup>[49]</sup></a> which the
modern composition-books have run so tiresomely to death,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Loose and periodic style, &amp;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and which is really a very unimportant technical
detail, follows; and then we return to those Delilahs
of the ancient rhetorician, Figures—Metaphor once
more, Antithesis, Personification, Hyperbole, &amp;c. Yet even this
is more to our purpose than the demonstration that follows,
showing that each kind of Rhetoric, judicial, deliberative, and
declamatory, should have its particular style. And with this
the handling of <i>lexis</i> proper closes, the rather brief remainder
of the book being devoted partly to <i>taxis</i> (<i>ordonnance</i>, as
Dryden would say), but with special reference to the needs
of  the  pleader, and partly to  a fresh  handling of  the old
questions of enthymeme, the dispositions of the audience, and
the like.</p>

<p class='c001'>It will be seen from this that the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, like the <cite>Poetics</cite>,
is invaluable to the historian of literary criticism, but that, in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>General effect of the</i> Rhetoric.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
this case as in that, literary criticism was only
partly the object in the writer’s eye, while even so
far as he had it before him, his views were very
largely limited, and were even in some cases distorted, coloured,
and positively spoilt by certain accidents of place, time, and circumstance.
As our poetical criticism was injuriously affected
by the non-existence of the novelist, so our prose criticism
is injuriously affected by the omnipresence of the orator.
As our Poetics were adulterated with ethic and other things,
so our Rhetoric is warped by poetical, jurisprudential, and other
preoccupations. In the first, poetry itself is not indeed
itself a secondary consideration, but divers secondary considerations
ride it, like a company of old men of the sea. In the
second, prose as prose is merely and avowedly a secondary
consideration: it is always in the main, and sometimes wholly,
a mere necessary instrument of divers practical purposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>To supplement these two general treatises, we could wish
for more particular applications, but we have not got them.
We have indeed some vestiges of work of the kind which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>not altogether encouraging. M. Egger<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c008'><sup>[50]</sup></a> has endeavoured to
extract some references to literary criticism from the general
<cite>Problems</cite>; but these deal at best with the remotest fringes of
the topic—why melancholy is so often apparent in persons of
genius, and the like,—questions indeed of the very first interest,
but not of the kind which we are here pursuing. In the
extant fragments, however, which belong or may have belonged
to the lost <cite>Homeric Problems</cite><a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c008'><sup>[51]</sup></a> (or <i>aporems</i> or <i>zetems</i>)
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Homeric Problems.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
we have metal more attractive. It may be said that
the scholiasts, through whom we have most of these
excerpts, were likely to select them according to the principles
which, as we shall see,<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c008'><sup>[52]</sup></a> governed themselves; but they do not
all come through scholiasts, and yet the complexion of all is
more or less uniform. It is that “ethical-dramatic” complexion,
as we may call it, which we have noticed and shall notice as
being the Greek critical “colour”—sometimes to the utter
exclusion, and almost always to the effacement, of actual criticism.
“Why did Agamemnon try experiments on the Greeks?
Why did Odysseus take his coat off? Why is Menelaus
represented as having no female companion? Why [a <a id='note49.20'></a><a href='#n_49.20'><ins class='correction'>curial</ins></a>
instance of that commentatorial <i>lues</i> which infects the greatest
commentators as the least, the most ancient as the most modern]
is Lampetie represented as carrying to the Sun the news
of the slaughter of his oxen, when the Sun sees everything?
Why did the poet make Paris a wretch who was not only
beaten in duel, who not only ran away, but who was specially
excited by love immediately afterwards?”</p>

<p class='c001'>These are mainly moral questions; but the great philosopher
appears to have carried his solicitude so far as to meddle with
military matters. “Why [somebody had asked], in <cite>Il.</cite> iv. 67-69,
are the cavalry represented as marshalled in front, the cowards
in the middle, and the best infantry behind?” If Aristotle
had heard of the “cavalry screen” he would no doubt have
used this <i>lusis</i>: as it is, it appears, he suggested that <i>prota</i>
means not “in front” but “on the wings.” And there is all
the quality which endeared Aristotle to the idler side (which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>was not the only side by any means) of Scholasticism, in his
condescension to the <i>aporia</i>—"If the gods drank nothing but
nectar, why is Calypso spoken of as ‘mixing’ for Hermes?
For any ‘mixture,’ even with water, is something different
from nectar; and, therefore, as the gods do not drink their
nectar neat, they do not drink that only." Quoth the great
master (in reply, or at least “Schol. T.” says so), “The word
does not only mean to ‘mix,’ but also simply to ‘pour,’ and this
is what Calypso did.” But why should Calypso herself and
Circe and Ino, alone of goddesses, have the epithet αὐδήεσσα?
Even he could not answer that, and was driven ignominiously
to suggest a change of reading.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not, I hope, necessary to say that I have no intention
of raising an inept laugh at the Great One. As has been already
said, the attitude of the Greeks to Homer was the attitude
of a seventeenth-century Puritan to the English Scriptures.
Every word, almost every letter, had its reason and its meaning—often
many more than one—which had to be reverently
sought out. The analogy, however, itself establishes and
makes clear my point, which is to show that an attitude of
this kind practically excludes pure literary criticism on the
one hand, and is exceedingly unlikely on the other to be taken
up by any one who is strongly bent towards such criticism.
We know how Milton, who must have had an exquisite critical
gusto originally, and who never wholly lost it, was by the cultivation
of such an attitude so stunted and checked in his taste
that he could throw the reading of Shakespeare in his dead
king’s face,<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c008'><sup>[53]</sup></a> dismiss the delightful work (hardly inferior to the
best of his own) of the Cavalier poets as “vulgar amorism”
and “trencher fury,” and even when he was not thinking of
matter, sink all critical perspective in his blind craze against
rhyme itself. The Homer-worship of the Greeks on the one
hand, and their philosophical preoccupations on the other, had
almost unavoidably a similar effect, though not so bad a one.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet the value of the two main documents is so inestimable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>that if the incompleteness and the shortcomings of the <cite>Poetics</cite>,
the unavoidable irrelevance of much of the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Value of the two main treatises.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
were far greater than they are, our gratitude for
both would still be hard to exaggerate. We have
here not merely the first constituting documents, the earliest
charters at once and discussions of European criticism, but
we have them from the hand of a master whose very weaknesses
make him, as compared with some other masters, specially
fit for the office of critic. For the magnificent but almost
always <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> and unpractical metaphysics of Plato, for the
shrewd but personal and rather unfair polemic of Aristophanes,
we have a patient examination of a subject in itself so rich
and varied, that one regrets having to point out that its riches
and its variety are not quite exhaustive. Nowhere, perhaps,
does Aristotle sketch the actual <i>Wesen</i> of the man of letters
with the dæmonic completeness of the author of the extraordinary
passage attributed to Simylus and quoted formerly;
but that might be, and probably is, a mere flash. His own
conclusions, only sometimes inadequate, very seldom positively
erroneous, exhibit the true modes of criticism as perhaps they
have never been exhibited since—with an equal combination
of patience and of power. It is impossible for Aristotle to do
harm, unless his principles are not merely taken too literally,
but augmented and falsified, as was done by the “classical”
criticism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is impossible
for any one who undertakes the office of a critic to
omit the study of him without very great harm. Let us first
review briefly what seem to be the shortcomings, accidental or
essential, of his performance, and then set down what its better
parts establish for us as the state of Literary Criticism at the
close of the first and greatest age of Greek literature, at the
close of the first age of the literature of Europe as a whole.</p>

<p class='c001'>Partly by mere induction from actual Greek practice, and
partly no doubt also as a genuine result of Greek
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Defects and drawbacks in the</i> Poetics.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
taste and literary philosophy, we find the importance
and the character of certain kinds of literature
treated with some extravagance. The importance
of Tragedy (as we are enabled to see clearly by the invaluable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>though rather unfair aid of the historic estimate) is altogether
exaggerated. It never, as a matter of fact, has held anything
like the position here assigned to it, save twice in two thousand
years and more, on each occasion for a generation or two only.
And there is no reason, in the order and logic of thought, why
it should hold such a position. It is again clearly evident
(though we owe the clearness again not to our own wits, but to
time and chance) that part of this importance is attained by
an illegitimate sacrifice, or an accidental ignoring, of the just
claims of other branches of literature—by making lyric a mere
playhouse handmaid, by converting the stage into a pulpit,
and by blocking out, not merely the existence, but the very
possibility, of the prose novel. We can see further that the
glorious achievements of the three great tragedians whom we
in part possess, and of others, probably not much inferior, whom
we have almost wholly lost, seduced their critic into taking what
he found in them too hastily for what ought to be found in all—induced
him (aided no doubt by the Greek taste generally) to
exalt Plot, to depress Character, to put quite undue stress on
artificial Unity. Lastly (to keep to the <cite>Poetics</cite>), we perceive a
most unfortunate, though by no means inexplicable, tendency
to give insufficient weight to Metre, and a decided inclination,
on the one hand not to give quite enough importance to Diction,
and on the other to lay down arbitrary rules about it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Something of the same general tendency manifests itself in
the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, reinforced by the necessary results of the Persuasion-theory,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>And in the</i> Rhetoric.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and the inordinate importance given
to Oratory. With every possible allowance for the
undoubtedly true plea that Aristotle had no intention of writing
a treatise on Prose Composition generally, but only one on
such Prose Composition as suited the purposes of the Orator,
we can see that if he had written <cite>Prosaics</cite>, to match the <cite>Poetics</cite>,
the same limitations would have appeared. He cannot free
himself from the notion that there is, after all, something
derogatory in paying great attention to style: and it is clear
that he does not <em>wish</em> to consider a piece of prose as a work of
art destined, first of all, if not finally, to fulfil its own laws on
the one hand, and to give pleasure on the other. The salutary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>but easily exaggerated difference between prose and poetic style
is actually exaggerated here. Above all, the germ of mischief,
if not exactly the mischief itself, is clearly discernible in his
account of the Figures of Speech. It was the drawback, not
merely (as is sometimes said unjustly) of the Platonic philosophy
only, but of all Greek philosophy, to “multiply entities”—to
take for granted that because names are given to things,
things must necessarily exist behind names. And so, instead
of regarding these Figures as merely rather loose, sometimes
not inconvenient, but in reality often superfluous, tickets for
certain literary devices and characteristics, there grew up, if
not in Aristotle himself, at any rate in his followers, a tendency
to regard the Figures (which were soon enormously multiplied)
as drugs or simples, existing independently, acting automatically,
and to be “thrown in,” as the physician exhibits his
pharmacop&oelig;ia, to produce this or that effect.</p>

<p class='c001'>But enough of this. It is the pleasanter, and, though not
in kind, yet in degree, the more important, business of the
historian, to call attention to the enormous positive
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Merits of both.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
advance which we make with these two books. It
is almost the advance from chaos to cosmos; and we shall
find nothing in all the rest of the history quite to match it,
though the resurrection of Criticism with the revival of learning,
and the reformation of it at the Romantic era, come nearest.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, we find the great kinds of literature, if not
finally and exhaustively, yet in nearly all their most important
points, discerned, marked off, and as far as possible furnished
with definitions. The most important of all demarcations, that
between poetry and prose, is rather taken for granted than
definitely argued out; but we see that, with whatever hesitations
and reservations, it <em>is</em> taken for granted. So, too, with
the kinds of poetry itself. If prose is inadequately treated,
both in general and in its departments, we have been able to
assign something like a reason for that; and a good deal is
actually done in this direction. In other words, the field, the
“claim,” of literary criticism is pretty fairly pegged out.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the second place, the only sound plan—that of taking actually
accomplished works of art and endeavouring to ascertain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>how it is that they give the artistic pleasure—is, with whatever
falterings, pretty steadily pursued. The critic, as Simylus,
Aristotle’s own contemporary, has it, consistently endeavours to
“grasp” his subject; and he does grasp it over and over again.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us review our positive gains from this grasp.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the “Imitation” doctrine of the <cite>Poetics</cite> is in some
respects disputable need not be denied; and that it lends itself
rather easily to serious misconstruction is certain.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Imitation.</i>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But let us remember also that it is an attempt—probably
the first attempt, and one which has not been much
bettered in all the improvements upon it—to adjust those proportions
of nature and art which actually do exist in poetry.
For by Imitation, whatever Aristotle did mean exactly, he most
certainly did <em>not</em> mean mere copying, mere tracing or plaster-of-Paris
moulding from nature. It is not quite impossible that
his at first sight puzzling objection to Alcidamas' use of the
“mirror” as a description of the <cite>Odyssey</cite> had something to do
with this.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c008'><sup>[54]</sup></a> A mirror, he would or might have said, reproduces
passively, slavishly, and without selection or alteration: the
artist selects, adapts, adjusts, and if necessary alters. Now this
is the true doctrine, and all deviations from, it, whether in the
shape of realism, impressionism,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c008'><sup>[55]</sup></a> and the like, in the one direction,
or of adherence to generalised convention on the other,
have always led to mischief soon or late. The artist must be
the mime, not the mirror: the reasonable, discreet, free-willed
agent, not the passive medium. The single dictum that poetry
does not necessarily deal with the actual but with the possible—that
it is therefore “more philosophic,” higher, more universal,
than history, though it requires both extension and limitation,
will put us more in the true critical position than any dictum
that we find earlier, or (it may be very frankly added) than
most that we shall find later.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c008'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>So, too, the all-important law that the end of art is pleasure
appears solidly laid down.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c008'><sup>[57]</sup></a> True, it is not laid down so explicitly
as it is in the <cite>Metaphysics</cite> and the <cite>Politics</cite>,
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The end of art: the</i> οἰκεία ἡδονή.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but it is assumed throughout, and such assumption
practically more valuable than argument. We
have left behind us the noble wrongheadedness of the Platonic
depreciation of pleasure; we are even past the stage when it
might seem necessary to plead humbly and with bated breath
for its <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>locus standi</i></span>. Moreover, the doctrine of the <i>oikeia hedone</i>
not only by implication lays down the end of all art, but guards
(in a fashion which should have been sovereign, though the
haste and heedlessness of men have too often robbed it of its
virtues) against one of the greatest dangers and mistakes of
criticism in time to come. That what we have to demand of a
work of literature is pleasure, and its own pleasure—how
simple this seems, how much a matter of course! Alas!
Aristotle himself is not entirely free from the charge of having
sometimes overlooked it, while since his time the great majority
of critical errors are traceable to this very overlooking. The
obstinate ignoring or the captious depreciation of Latin literature
by the later Greeks; the wooden “Arts of Poetry” of the
Latins themselves; the scorn of Chaucer for “rim-ram-ruffing”;
of the Renaissance for mediæval literature; of Du Bellay for
Marot; of Harvey for the <cite>Faerie Queene</cite>; of Restoration criticism
for the times before Mr Waller improved our numbers; of our
Romantic critics for Dryden and Johnson; of Mr Matthew
Arnold for French poetry,—all these things, and many others
of the same class, come from the ignoring of the <i>oikeia hedone</i>,
from the obstinate insistence that this thing shall be other
than it is, that this poet shall be not himself but somebody else.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, whatever we may think of the relative importance
assigned to plot and to character by Aristotle, as well as of not
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Theory of Action</i>,<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
a few minor details of his theory of plot or action,
there is no denying the huge lift given to the intelligent
enjoyment of literature by the distinction of these two
important elements, and by the analysis of action if not of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>character. With the aid of such refinements we cease, as
Dryden has it, to “like grossly,” to accept our pleasure without
distinction of its gradations or inquiry into its source. The
artist no longer aims in the dark; his processes are no longer
mere rules—if rules at all—of thumb. And this is also the
justification, though by no means the sole justification, of such
minor matters as <i>peripeteia</i> and <i>anagnorisis</i>, as <i>desis</i> and <i>lusis</i>.
True, there is here, as in the case of the Figures, a danger that a
convenient designation <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a posteriori</i></span> may be taken as a primæval
and antecedent law. But this is the, in one sense, inevitable,
in another very evitable and gratuitous, danger of all
philosophical, scientific, and artistic inquiry. Fools can never
be prevented from taking the means for the end, the ritual for
the worship, the terminology for the spirit; but means and
ritual and terminology are not the less good things for that.</p>

<p class='c001'>Most of the points hitherto mentioned, though requiring, at
the time and in the circumstances, immense pains, acuteness, and
patience to discover and arrange them, are not beyond
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and of</i> ἁμαρτία.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the reach of somewhat more than ordinary
patience, acuteness, and pains. The theory of ἁμαρτία, as has
been shown since by its triumphant justification in the other great
tragedy—the tragedy which seems at first sight to flout Aristotle’s
rules—is a stroke of genius. To this day it has not been fully
accepted; to this day persons, sometimes very far indeed from
fools, persist in confusing the tragic with the merely painful,
with the monstrous, with the sentimental, and so forth. Aristotle
knew better, and has given here a touch of the really
higher criticism—of that criticism which does not waste time
over the subject as such, which does not potter overmuch
about details of expression, but which goes to the root of the
matter, to the causes of a certain pleasure indissolubly associated
with literature, if not strictly literary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor, perhaps, ought we to be least grateful for the remarks
on <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lexis</i></span>—on poetic style proper. In details we may fail fully
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Of Poetic Diction.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to understand them, or, understanding, may disagree
with them; and there is no doubt that they are
somewhat tinged with that superior view of style, as something
a little irrelevant, a little vulgar, which appears more fully in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, and which, while it has not entirely disappeared
even at the present day, was naturally rife at a time fresh from
the views, and still partly under the influence, of Socrates and
Plato. Here once more we find those evidences of directness of
grasp which are what we seek, especially in the main description
of poetic style, as being on the one hand “clear,” and yet
on the other not “low,” and in the further specification of the
means by which these characteristics are to be secured. More
particularly is this to be noticed in the indication of the ξένον—that
is to say, the unfamiliar—as the means of avoiding “lowness.”
Here from the very outset we see that Aristotle (as
Dante far later did, and as Wordsworth later again did <em>not</em>)
recognised the necessity of “Poetic diction,”—the necessity, that
is to say, of causing a slight shock, a slight surprise, in order
to bring about the poetic pleasure. And by the example which
he gives of heightening and lowering the effect alternately, by
substituting different words in the same general context, we see
how accurately he had divined the importance of this diction,
whether we may or may not think that the fact is quite consistent
with his exaggerated view of Action. Aristotle’s verbal
criticisms are never, as (to speak frankly) the verbal criticisms
of the ancients too often are, mere <em>glossography</em>—mere dictionary
work. They are invariably concerned with, and directed to,
the literary value of the word, and that is what we have to
look to.</p>

<p class='c001'>The positive gains, of or from the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, are less, but
hardly less. It follows from the special limitations of the plan,
which have already been dealt with, that we have no special
theory of prose as such, and that, not merely some shortcomings,
but some positive and mischievous delusions (such as the confusion
of style with delivery), result from it. But, in divers
casual animadversions, he shows us that if by good fortune he
had given us <cite>Prosaics</cite>, the book would, though it were not
more faultless than the <cite>Poetics</cite>, have been quite as valuable.
And as it is, these things supply us with invaluable hints,
glimpses, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>points de repère</i></span>. The first, and not the least valuable,
is the distinction, used also in the <cite>Poetics</cite>, but there only casually
and in a glance, of words as κύρια and ξένα. Purity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“Amplification,” Propriety, while they at least suggest those
dangers of misapprehended terminology which have been
already dealt with, supply Criticism with those appropriate
classifications, and that necessary plant, without which no art
can exist. And the importance of the rhythm-section cannot
be exaggerated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed I have sometimes thought that, without extreme
arbitrariness or fancifulness, even the <cite>Pistis</cite> part of the
Rhetoric may be made subservient to pure criticism. It is not
so very far from the effect of persuading or convincing the
hearer to that of producing on the reader the required effect—it
may be of persuasion and conviction, it may be of information,
or it may be simply of that subduing and charming which
is the end and aim of the prose artist as such, whether his
name be Burke or Scott, Browne or Arnold, and whether his
nominal division of literature be history or fiction, criticism or
philosophy, things human or things divine. The “Colours of
Good and Evil,” the tendencies of the readers, the fashions of
the day and the passions of all days—these are things which
beyond all dispute will very mightily affect the appreciation of
a book, and which, it may be argued not quite improperly, condition,
in no small degree likewise, its attainment of its object,
its administration of its own pleasure.</p>

<p class='c001'>However this may be, the point, already more than once
touched upon, that we have now a Literary Criticism, regularly
if not fully constituted, may be regarded as established without
need of further exposition or argument. In some respects, indeed,
we have got no further than Aristotle; we are still arguing
on his positions, defending or attacking his theses. In
others we have indeed got a good deal further, by virtue chiefly
of the mere accretion of material and experience. We have,
perhaps, learned (or some of us have) to resign ourselves rather
more to the facts than he, with the enthusiasm of the first
stage still hardly behind him, was able to do. We are less inclined
to prescribe to the artist what he shall do, and more
tempted to accept what the artist does, and see what it can
teach as well as how it can please us. But in the wider sense
of critical method we have not got so very far beyond him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the poetical division. While if we have got beyond him in the
direction of prose (as perhaps we have), the advance has been
very late, and can hardly be said even now to have, by common
consent and as a clear matter of fact, covered, occupied, and
reduced to order the territory on to which it has pushed.
Great as are Aristotle’s claims in almost every department of
human thought with which he meddles, it may be doubted
whether in any he deserves a higher place than in this. He
is the very Alexander of Criticism, and his conquests in this
field, unlike those of his pupil in another, remain practically
undestroyed, though not unextended, to the present day.</p>

<p class='c001'>Attempts have been made to confine Aristotle’s slighting remarks on <i>lexis</i> to
mere “delivery.” It is true that in the whole passage there is a certain confusion
of the different senses of “elocution.” But in this sentence Aristotle has just
said, τὸ περὶ τὴν λέξιν <em>not</em> ὑπόκρισιν—that is to say, has covered the entire ground
which he is going to discuss. Even if φορτικὸν be violently restricted, by the help
of καὶ before τό, to ὑποκριτική (which occurs further back), the general drift will

<p class='c001'><a href='#r37'>37</a>. He does, no doubt, refer to the
prose mimes, <i>v. infra</i>, and in referring
at the same time to the “Socratic
dialogues” he may be specially thinking
of the “Egyptian and other” stories
with which Socrates was wont, half to
please, half to puzzle, his hearers. But
his whole treatment of Tragedy and
Epic is really based on some such assumption

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r38'>38</a>. I need  hardly express, but could
not possibly omit the expression of, my
indebtedness to my friend and colleague
Professor Butcher’s admirable
edition and translation of the work in
<cite>Aristotle’s Theory of Poetry and Fine
Art</cite> (London, 2nd ed., 1898), a book
which, as much as any other for many
years past, enables English scholarship
to hold its head up with that of other
countries.  Nor need I make any apologies
for occasionally differing, on the
purely critical side, with him as to the
interpretation of a document which is
admittedly very obscure in parts, and
on even the clearest parts of which
opinion, not  demonstration, must decide
in very many cases.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. There  are  strong  arguments  for
rendering τῶν τοιούτων not “such” but
“these,” and Professor Butcher actually
does so.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f40'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r40'>40</a>. Here one of the first very important
differences of interpretation comes
in. Professor Butcher would translate
ζῷον “picture,” as though it were short
for ζῷον γεγραμμένον. Scholars differ
whether the word <em>can</em> by itself have
this meaning, and on such a point I
have no pretensions to decide. But its
more common sense is certainly “living
organism,” and I feel certain that
this is the only meaning which makes
full critical sense here. To begin with,
Aristotle has just used it in this way,
and in the second place the analogy of
another <em>art</em> would come in very ill.
We want a comparison drawn from
<em>nature</em>, to give us the law for the imitation
of nature.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f41'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r41'>41</a>. “Episode” is here defined in quite
a new sense as the dialogue <em>between</em>
choruses; “Exodus” as that which no
chorus follows. The chapter is doubtful—or
something more.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f42'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r42'>42</a>. In all modern languages, though
no doubt not in Greek, “Imitation”
carries with it a fatal suggestion of
copying previous examples of art, and
not going direct to Nature at all. I
think there is no reasonable doubt that
this suggestion is responsible by itself
for much of the mistakes of modern
“Classical” criticism in the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries.
You must “imitate” Homer, Virgil,
Milton, not “represent” Nature.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f43'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r43'>43</a>. Those who do not care to “grapple
with whole libraries” will find excellent

Egger, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 267-300.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f44'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. No edition with commentary can
here be recommended to English readers
with quite such confidence as Professor
Butcher’s <cite>Poetics</cite>. That of E. M. Cope
(3 vols., Cambridge, 1877), with a
fourth, but earlier, volume of Introduction
(London, 1867), is extremely
full and useful, though the Germans
(see Römer’s edition after Spengel,
Pref., p. xxxiv) scoff at its text. Dr
Welldon’s translation is well spoken
of: and the old “Oxford” version,
reprinted with some corrections in
Bohn’s Library, is not contemptible,
while Hobbes’s “Brief” (or Analysis),
which accompanies it, is very valuable
indeed. But here, as elsewhere, he
who neglects the original neglects it at
his peril.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f45'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r45'>45</a>. Professor Butcher rather doubts
this stress of mine on the prepositions,
and points out to me that ἐπιλέγομαι
(in the sense of reading) is almost exclusively
Herodotean, and never established
itself generally in Greek. But
he admits that the more usual employment
of ἀναγιγνώσκω for “reading
<em>aloud</em>” bears on my point.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two remarkable books which have been discussed at length
in the foregoing chapter represent, no doubt, the highest condition,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Development of Criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but certainly a condition, of Greek criticism
in the second half of the fourth century before
Christ. This criticism had not, indeed, yet assumed the position
of a recognised art. It was at best a more or less dimly
recognised function of Rhetoric, which on the one side was
made to include a great deal which is not literary criticism at
all, and on the other hand was made to exclude Poetics. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Rhetoric, from this time onwards, more and more tends to become
the Art of Literary Criticism generally, and to absorb
Poetics within itself. So that on the one hand we shall find,
among the Latins, Quintilian, whose strict business is with the
strictly oratorical side of prose rhetoric, dealing freely with
poetry, and on the other, among the Greeks, Longinus (whose
main subject is poetry), not hesitating to draw examples from
prose. Nor may it be wrong to discern in this awkward separation
of the two parts of criticism, and the yet more awkward
adulteration of prose criticism with matters really foreign to it,
an unconscious—nay, an unwilling—recognition of fact. For
Poetry deals first of all with form, Prose with matter; though
the matter can never be a matter of entire indifference to
Poetry, and the form becomes of more and more importance as
we ascend from the lower to the higher prose.</p>

<p class='c001'>After Aristotle we fall back, for the ages immediately following,
on the dreary and perilous chaos of fragments and titles.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Theophrastus and others.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
From the extant work, indeed, of his chief disciple,
Theophrastus, we could guess that he dealt largely
in Rhetoric. It is no rash conjecture that the famous <cite>Characters</cite>
themselves were intended, after a fashion of which
we have but too many other examples, to provide orators
and writers with cut-and-dried types on which to base
their rhetorical appeals. Nay, we have titles as well as fragments
of works of his bearing on the subject,—<i>on Style</i>, <i>on
Comedy</i>,—but nothing whereon to base a real estimate.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c008'><sup>[58]</sup></a> And
what is true of Theophrastus is true of hundreds of others.
Only those who are fond of the pastime of letting down buckets
into empty wells can derive the slightest satisfaction from
knowing, or at least being informed, that Aristotle of Cyrene
wrote a <cite>Poetic</cite> of which we have nothing, and Phanias of
Eresus a work <cite>On Poets</cite> of which we have a couple of scraps.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c008'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
It is certain that a very considerable literature, at least ostensibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>critical, existed, dating from the third and later
centuries.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two writers, later in time, not of much critical fertility but
of some interest, will illustrate for us the attitude of two Greek
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Criticism of the later Philosophical Schools: The Stoics.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
philosophical schools to criticism. None of these
schools except the Peripatetics (and in a negative
sort of way the Platonists) deserved very well of
our Tenth Muse. The Stoics—when they were not
in that mood of disdainful tolerance which is represented by
Epictetus' doctrine of “the Inn,”<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c008'><sup>[60]</sup></a> of less tolerance still and
more disdain as shown by Marcus Aurelius,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c008'><sup>[61]</sup></a> or of affected
contempt, almost pure and simple, as in Seneca,<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c008'><sup>[62]</sup></a> which was
their later attitude—seem in their earlier days to have devoted
themselves with great vigour to grammatical investigations,
and at all times to have affected the allegorical style. But we
cannot wonder that they spent no pains on investigating, still
less that they spent no pains on championing, that mixed intellectual
and sensual pleasure which is the business and the
glory of literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attitude, however, of their principal antagonists is all the
more surprising. The Cynic vulgarity and insolence could not
be expected to busy itself profitably with letters, and, as we
shall see shortly, the ancient Pyrrhonists have at least left us
nothing to show that they could combine with their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Que sais-je?</i></span>
on philosophical points, the keen literary enjoyment and the
discriminating literary appreciation of their great modern
champion. But the attitude of the Epicureans to literature is
one of the most surprising things in the history of ancient
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c001'>One might have supposed, not merely that a Hedonist philosophy
would apply itself most joyfully and energetically to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>investigation and the vindication of one of the greatest of all
sources of <i>ataraxia</i> and <i>aponia</i>,<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c008'><sup>[63]</sup></a> but that it would do
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Epicureans: Philodemus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
so with all the more vigour as thus vindicating itself
from the common charge of esteeming only sensual
pleasures. Yet, though the scanty wreckage of original Epicurean
writing warns us not to be too peremptory, there is
absolutely no evidence that Epicurus, or any of his followers,
took this side. Nay, the whole evidence available is distinctly
against any such supposition. Perhaps we could have no
stronger testimony to the reluctance with which antiquity
took the view of literature as a pleasure-giver, or rather to the
rarity with which such a view even presented itself. If we were
here indulging further in speculation, it might not be improper
to suggest that the atomic and necessitarian theory of Epicurus
deprived the operations of the artist of half their interest.
But this would be to travel out of bounds. It is enough to
say that Epicurus is accused of slighting critical discussion
altogether, that his chief disciple Metrodorus appears to have
written a book on poetry which was a general attack on it as a
useless and futile thing, and that the fragments of Philodemus
of Gadara, which have been salvaged from Herculaneum, go to
support the same idea.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time, we must not lay too much stress on this.
The charge against Epicurus and Metrodorus rests, mainly if
not wholly, on the testimony of Plutarch, who, as we shall see,
took the merely ethical view of literature, and is found in that
treatise of the <cite>Moralia</cite> in which he sets himself to prove that
Epicureanism cannot even give the pleasure at which it aims
And the tolerably abundant fragments of Philodemus<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c008'><sup>[64]</sup></a> are,
even after all the pains spent on them, in such a chaos that
only extremely temerarious arguers will do more than take
a vague inference from them. The remark which the latest
editor of this puzzle has made about one book—"It is difficult
to know whether Philodemus or his opponent is speaking"—applies,
I should say, to almost all. Not only is this the
case; but we can see, with hardly any danger of mistake, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>if this difficulty were removed, and if we had the whole treatise
fully and fairly written out before us, our state would be very
little the more gracious. A very great, perhaps the greater,
part of it seems to have been occupied with the discussion of one
of those endless technical questions—"Is Rhetoric an <em>art</em> or is
it not?"—in which antiquity seems to have taken an interest,
the utter unintelligibility of which to us is only tempered
by the wise reflection that plenty of our questions to-day will
seem equally “ashes, cinders, dust” to students two thousand
years hence. The real and solid conclusion is, once more, that
we have not lost nearly so much as we seem to have lost
by the disappearance of these endless treatises on rhetoric
and on poetry. It is possible, of course, that one in a thousand
of them might have been another Περὶ Ὕψους: it is
far more probable that not one would have been anything of
the kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>If Acatalepsy<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c008'><sup>[65]</sup></a>, the doxy of the Pyrrhonists, has been somewhat
more fortunate in one way than her close connection
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Pyrrhonists: Sextus Empiricus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the Ataraxia of the Garden, she has paid for that
fortune in another. Except in the magnificent
poem of Lucretius, we have no complete document
of Epicurean philosophy, and there the philosophy
is utterly eclipsed, burnt up, washed away, by the blaze and
the torrent of the poetry. No such disturbing element enters
into the two very businesslike expositions of philosophic doubt
which we possess in the <cite>Pyrrhonic Sketches</cite> and the <cite>Against
the Dogmatists</cite> of Sextus Empiricus.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c008'><sup>[66]</sup></a> But, if the one writer
is almost too much of a poet, the other is very much too
little of a prose writer. Scepticism has assuredly no necessary
connection with dulness, though it may have a good deal with
levity. But Sextus Empiricus is one of the dullest writers of
antiquity. There is not a spark, not a glimmer even, in his
phrase, which is chiefly made up of the most damnable iteration
of technical terms; his arrangement is desultory; and beyond
a raking together of all the arguments, good, bad, and indifferent,
for general or particular agnosticism, that he has read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>or can think of, he seems to find it impossible to go. At the
same time, modern writers have found by no means a bad
subject for such handling in the contradictions, the inconsistencies,
the ineptitudes of literary critics: the eighteenth
century especially, from the writings of the great Scriblerus
to the <cite>Pursuits of Literature</cite>, is full of such things. And if
there is little of the kind (for there is something) in Sextus,
we may not improperly set it down to the fact that he found
little to fasten upon.</p>

<p class='c001'>What he gives is contained in three of the four last sections
of <cite>Against the Dogmatists</cite>, those dealing with Grammarians,
Rhetoricians, and Musicians respectively. In the last, which is
the shortest, I do not know that the example of childish
cavilling quoted by Egger—that a bard was set to look after
Clytæmnestra, and Clytæmnestra murdered her husband—is
more or less childish than the solemn sophism (not quoted by
him) with which the chapter and the book closes, to the effect
that as there is no “time”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c008'><sup>[67]</sup></a> in the wide sense, so there can be
no “time”—feet, rhythms, measures—in the narrow.</p>

<p class='c001'>The section on Rhetoric is also short, and turns almost wholly
upon the old <i>aporia</i> whether Rhetoric is an art or not, with
others of a similar kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the grammatical section, that does touch us nearer;
indeed, when Sextus divides Grammar into two parts, adopting
for the second the definition of Dionysius of Thrace, that
“Grammar is the knowledge<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c008'><sup>[68]</sup></a> of what is said by the poets and
prose writers,”<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c008'><sup>[69]</sup></a> we seem to be almost at home. But in this
expectation we should be counting without our host, the
sceptical physician, and, indeed, without antiquity generally.
We have first quibbling <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à perte de vue</i></span> about <i>empeiria</i>, then other
definitions, then considerations of the mere grammatical
elements. Only after a long time does Sextus come to the
grammarian’s business of <em>interpreting</em> the poets and prose
writers. And then he not only seems to be dealing with men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>of straw, but answers them with, as Luther would say, a most
“stramineous” argument. Poetry, it seems, they say (and it is
fair to Sextus to admit that Plutarch and other people do in
effect say this) is useful as containing wise saws and philosophical
instances: grammar is necessary to understand poetry:
therefore, grammar is good. He does not care actually to
attack poetry, but observes that, in so far as it provides matter
useful or necessary for life, it is always clear, and wants no
grammatical exposition, while (662-663) whatsoever deals in
unfamiliar stories, or is enigmatically expressed, is useless, so that
grammar can do nothing useful with it. A subsequent contention,
that grammarians know neither the matter nor the words
of literature, though a little sweeping, might have chapter and
verse given for it in the case of at least some critics. But when
Sextus establishes his first point by triumphing over the poor
grammarians for not having perceived in a Homeric epithet
an allusion to a pharmaceutical property, and in Euripides
a point of clinical practice (671), he is either making a heavy
joke or is utterly off the critical standpoint.</p>

<p class='c001'>A third school, in its various stages, has perhaps a better, if a
vague, repute for attention to literature. Perverse as was in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Academics.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
many respects the attitude of Plato to the subject in
detail, it was impossible (or might have seemed
impossible) that his doctrine of <i>psychagogia</i>,<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c008'><sup>[70]</sup></a> and the magnificent
eulogies bestowed in the <cite>Ion</cite> and the <cite>Phædrus</cite> on that
poetry towards which he is elsewhere so severe, should not
induce his followers—at whatever great a distance—to do likewise.
It seems, however, to have been found easier by the
earlier Academics to follow the crotchet than the enthusiasm,
and many of the puerile and servile quibbles to which we
have referred as appearing in Sextus Empiricus seem to be of
Academic origin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Neo-Platonists, at least, might be looked to with some
hope. Their spirit at any rate was not negative, and they seem,
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Neo-Platonists.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>as a rule, to have been diligent and eager students of literature.
But, on the other hand, their tendency towards
mysticism, and also the strong colour which their
philosophy took from the East, made them especially susceptible
to the temptations of allegory, which, as we have seen and
shall see, was a Delilah of criticism in almost all its stages in
Greece. And when they escaped this they nearly always
succumbed to the other temptations of merely grammatical
and textual inquiries, or to those of an abstract and theoretical
æstheticism, which leaves the actual estimation of literature as
literature out of sight.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, from the two great chiefs of the school, Plotinus and
Proclus, we have short treatises on the Beautiful—by Proclus
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Plotinus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in the form of a commentary (not complete) on the
<cite>First Alcibiades</cite> of Plato, while the tractate of
Plotinus<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c008'><sup>[71]</sup></a> attaches itself somewhat less closely to the <cite>Hippias</cite>.
From the very first this latter keeps rigidly and laboriously to
the abstract. Beauty, we are told, specially affects the sense of
sight, but the ear perceives it in eloquence, poetry, and music.
It is also in emotions, in virtue, in science. Is all this derived
from one principle or from many? What is it, or what are
they? But as there is both essential and accidental beauty, we
must first settle what the attractive principle is. A shrewd
question, and one which, if followed out in the proper direction,
would lead straight to the best criticism of literature; but,
unluckily, Plotinus does not so follow it.</p>

<p class='c001'>He proceeds to examine and expose the difficulties attending
the proposition that beauty comes mainly or chiefly from proportion
of parts. There must rather, he holds, be in the soul
some faculty of perceiving the divine quality, whether manifested
in proportion or in anything else. The beauty of bodily substances
depends on their affinity with the divine: the beauty of things
not recognised by the senses depends on their identity with it.
In yet other words, and from a yet other point of view, Beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>is Good, Ugliness is Evil: the attraction of the first pair, the
repulsion of the second, easily explains itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the organ wherewith beauty is perceived, it is the
soul: the senses only apprehend shadow-beauties—reflections
and suggestions of reality. The faculty must be cultivated;
it must be refined by high thinking and plain living, and at
last it will see that, though Good and Beauty are one, yet
Beauty is in a lower sphere than Good—is, in fact, but an
imitation of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this is not merely Platonic—it is itself beautiful and
good: it is noble, it is true, it deserves everything that can
possibly be said in its favour. But for the actual purposes of
literary criticism it is but as a sweet song in a foreign
language. It will hardly help us in the very least degree to
distinguish Shelley from the most estimable of minor poets, or
Thackeray from the least estimable of minor novelists. It does,
by way of illustration, touch literary criticism once itself, for it
refers to “the admirable allegory” which represents Ulysses as
using all his efforts to withdraw himself from the enchantments
of Circe and the passion of Calypso, resisting all the enticements
of bodily beauty and delight. To the greatest as to the
least of Neo-Platonists the allegorical explanation is itself
Circe, itself Calypso; and instead of endeavouring to escape
from it, he willing meets it willing, and abides contented in
those ever-open arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is especially seen in the writings, known or attributed,
of the most industrious and variously accomplished, if not the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Porphyry.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
most gifted, of the Neo-Platonists, Porphyry. Porphyry
has to his credit two documents which, in
title and subject, are undoubtedly literary, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Quæstiones
Homericæ</cite></span> and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Antro Nympharum</cite></span>; while some would take
away from Plutarch, and give to him, the work on Homer’s
Life and Poems, which has undergone the indignity of being
spoken of as “miserable” by M. Egger,<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c008'><sup>[72]</sup></a> while, on the other
hand, Archbishop Trench<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c008'><sup>[73]</sup></a> gives the author, whoever he was,
what would, if deserved, be the very high praise of having thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>early “recognised very distinctly the charm which rhyme
has for the ear.” If this were so, I should be inclined to put
him together with Philostratus, as having at least stumbled on
a great critical truth. But perhaps the words will hardly bear
the burden, for the writer, quoting μελισσάων ἀδινάων ...
ἐρχομενάων, adds, “These words and their likes add much grace
and pleasure to the expression.”<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c008'><sup>[74]</sup></a> And unluckily, the remark
occurs only in an examination of Homer <em>by figures</em>, where this
is taken as representing <i>homoeoteleuton</i>. Now, <i>homoeoteleuton</i>,
though it is a sort of poor relation of rhyme, belongs to that
branch of the family which more rightly bears the name
of Jingle. However this may be, the treatise, as a whole,
would scarcely add to the reputation either of Plutarch or
of Porphyry.</p>

<p class='c001'>The two more certain works, on the other hand, belong
only to those outskirts of our subject which have been so
often characterised. The <cite>Questions</cite><a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c008'><sup>[75]</sup></a> busy themselves almost
wholly with the text and the meaning, though it is fair to say
that Porphyry is much above the usual scholiast in sense and
judgment, and sometimes approaches criticism proper. This
approach, however, is generally, if not always, displayed in the
same direction as that of Aristotle’s extant <cite>Homeric Problems</cite>
(<i>v. supra</i>, p. <a href='#Page_49'>49</a> <i>sq.</i>) and of many of the remarks made by the
Master in the twenty-fifth chapter of the <cite>Poetics</cite>—the direction,
namely, of solving material <i>aporiæ</i>, such as Aristotle’s own
comment on ζωρότερον κέραιε, and Porphyry’s<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c008'><sup>[76]</sup></a> on the demurrer
why Penelope did not send Telemachus for aid to her own
parents? The process, in short, illustrates frequently, if not
always, that curious <em>swerving</em> from the purely literary question
which we so often notice. Almost any magnet is strong enough
to draw the commentator away from that question. He will
even ask, and gravely answer, the question, Why men, but
not gods, are represented as washing their hands before dinner?</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Antro Nympharum</cite></span>,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c008'><sup>[77]</sup></a> on the other hand, is the principal
example, in intermediate times, of that allegorical interpretation
or misinterpretation which, unless kept severely in order,
is sure to usurp the place of the criticism to which it can
at best be ancillary. From no other members of the school,
so far as I know, have we anything that comes even as near
to criticism as this.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the Schools have led us far from our immediate context
and subject, the literature of the three centuries after Aristotle.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Rhetoricians and Grammarians.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
From all this literature it cannot be said that one
single text, of undoubted genuineness and substantive
importance, preserves for us the critical
views of the something like three hundred years which passed
between the philosopher’s death in 322 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> and the flourishing
of Dionysius of Halicarnassus in the third decade before Christ.
Two things, however, may be said to be, in a round and general
manner, ascertained as having either taken definite form or
come into existence during this time; and though both are conditioned
very uncomfortably by our lack of texts, they are both
of the utmost importance to the history of Criticism, and they
can both be spoken of, with caution, indeed, but with some
general induction not too far from certainty. The one is the
establishment of the teaching of Rhetoric in a form which
underwent no very important modification for five or six
hundred years, and no absolute revolution for fifteen or sixteen
hundred. The other is the birth of Verbal Criticism—of the
kind of criticism which long arrogated to itself something like
a primary title to the name, and has, in the same or other forms,
not yet quite given up its pretensions—under the auspices of
Aristarchus and the great Alexandrian school of commentators.
The importance assigned to these can be justified from the fact,
whether that fact be or be not in itself distasteful, that of such
ancient criticism as remains to us, by far the larger part is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>busied rather in these two directions than in that of Criticism
proper. On the one hand, we have the huge body of work, not
even so quite completely collected, which fills the seven thousand
pages of Walz’s <cite>Rhetores Græci</cite>, and the less voluminous
thesaurus which does duty for Roman effort on the same lines.
On the other, we have the body (whether as great or greater
its more scattered condition does not permit one to say certainly)
of Scholia. And we constantly find—to our grief—that
the better writers (of whom, at least in some cases, something
survives to us) are apt to stray, in one or other of these directions,
from the proper path of that criticism which, though it does not
neglect either Rhetorical method or verbal minuteness, yet busies
itself mainly with far other questions, asking, “Is this writer
or this work, on the whole, good or bad as work or writer?”
“What variety of the poetical or prosaic pleasure does he or it
give?” “What are the sources, so far as they are traceable,
of this pleasure?” “What is the special idiosyncrasy of the
author or the book?” “What place do both hold, in relation
to other books or authors of the same or other times, in the
same or other languages?” It will not be otiose if we attempt
to sketch, from the extant examples, what the Rhetorician and
the Scholiast, as a rule, actually did, what aim they seem to
have set before them, what connection with the best literary
criticism they seem to have had.</p>

<p class='c001'>We need not very greatly disturb ourselves at the fact that,
of complete Rhetorical treatises, we have probably nothing
between Aristotle and Dionysius, if even that attributed to the
latter be genuine; and that modern investigations refuse
indorsement to the genuineness of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Interpretatione</cite></span>
attributed to Demetrius Phalereus,<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c008'><sup>[78]</sup></a> which would, if it were
genuine, be the oldest we have. For, from myriad petty indications,
there is no reasonable reason for believing that a
genuine <cite>Rhetoric</cite> by Demetrius would be very different from
that which is now attributed to some later Alexandrian writer.
Rhetoric, as we have seen, had from the first been hampered
by special attributions and limitations; nor (as so often happens
in history) did these limitations cease, at any rate to some extent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>to work when their causes ceased to exist. The sentry
in St James’s Park, who continued to be posted till the other
day at the garden-door of a certain house, because (as it was
found out long after the reason had been forgotten) some Royal
or Ambassadorial personage had been quartered there for a
time generations earlier, was a great and admirable allegory—and
in wiser days than our own would have remained undisturbed
as such. Moreover, though the political importance of
Rhetoric decreased, and the assemblies of Greece became mere
parish councils; though the law courts went more and more
either by fixed codes or personal influence; though philosophy
became <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>phluaria</i></span>; Rhetoric, having once, with unconscious cunning,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Rhetoric early stereotyped.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
got Education practically into her hands, retained
that powerful engine and all the influence that
it confers. It would seem however that, pretty early,
a very mischievous process of stereotyping took place. Grammar
and Logic, the companions of Rhetoric, were to some extent
saved by their having positive things to deal with—the facts of
speech and the Laws of Thought. But Rhetoric dealt with fashion,
opinion, etiquette: and except when, in the hands of superior
persons like Dionysius and Longinus among the Greeks, like
Quintilian among the Latins, it shook itself free and became
the Literary Criticism that it ought to be, it became a rather
parlous thing. It early developed the disease of technical
jargon, in that specially dangerous form—recognisable perhaps
in times nearer our own than those of Demetrius or even of
Hermogenes—the form of giving wantonly new meanings to
common words. It elaborated an arbitrary and baneful system
of “common form”—of schemes, and types, and conventional
schedules, into which, by a minimum of intellectual exertion, the
orator or writer could throw what he wanted. On the one
hand, it constantly increased and multiplied the Figures; on
the other hand, it invented a system of things called <i>staseis</i>—"states
of the case"—which attempted to classify and stereotype
the matter of the orator’s brief, just as the Figures classified and
stereotyped his oratorical means of dealing with it. In other
words, and to adopt the terms of literary criticism itself, the
stop-watch ruled supreme. In the more technical examples of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Rhetorical art, such as those of the far later but characteristic
Hermogenes, it is often difficult to find anything which touches
literary criticism at all. Only the greater men, as has been
said, were ever able to break free; and the sort of scorn with
which they speak of their predecessors—Quintilian of the
figure-mongers, Longinus of Cæcilius—is invaluable (especially
as neither Quintilian nor Longinus seems to have been at all
a bad-blooded person) as showing how irksome the traditional
Rhetoric was felt to be by men who had in them the sense of
literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Scholiast, on the other hand, if of a less traceable creation,
is of almost equally old lineage, and he may conveniently
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Grammatical and Scholiastic criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
be dealt with, in such detail and variety as he
requires, before the more formidable bulk of the
School Rhetoricians occupies us. We have already
seen, in glimpses, that the restless curiosity of the
Greeks took very early to purely philological inquiry, to the
separation and naming of parts of speech, to the codification
of grammar. And it was impossible that a people furnished
with such an admirable language and so early developing accomplishment,
both in music and poetry, should not, at a stage
proportionately much earlier than in other cases, discover and
prosecute inquiries as to Prosody. To this day, Greek grammar
is, to some tastes at any rate, the only grammar which is not
too arbitrary or too jejune to excite any interest. The wonderful
symmetry of Greek accidence, the mazy but by no means unplanned
intricacy of Greek syntax, have had power to fascinate
schoolboys who, both at that age and later, were merely bored
by the arbitrary niceties of Latin, and refused to accept the
attempts that have been made to impose an appearance of
system on the antinomianism and the compromises of English.
As for Greek metre, though the subject has not the historic
interest—the interest of great yet not inexplicable changes—which
belongs to the prosody of the two other languages just
brought into comparison, it is capable of much more exact handling.
And, in particular, the peculiar structure of Greek choric
verse, that hitherto unparalleled blend which unites much of the
liberty of prose with the ordered charm of poetry, gave practically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>endless occupation to intellects which would soon have
been satiated with the comparative monotony of Latin, and
which might have recoiled before the apparent lawlessness of
English.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not very certain at what precise time these two studies
(or, if we take prosody to be a part of grammar, this joint-study)
began to occupy considerable numbers of professional students.
But it must have been a tolerably early one, and by degrees
the grammarian in his pure function, the scholiast in his
applied one, became recognised personages.</p>

<p class='c001'>The profession, so to speak, may be said (according to the
common tradition, but with sufficient justice) to have been
formally constituted in the third and second centuries
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Pergamene and Alexandrian Schools.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
before Christ, under the patronage of the
successors of Alexander at the courts of Pergamus
and Alexandria. To these schools belong
the famous names of Zenodotus (the earliest, and belonging
partly to the third century), of Crates of Mallos, and, above all,
of Aristarchus. It is, perhaps, only at first sight surprising
that, famous as the names are, they are for the most part names
only. Not one single work, nor even any substantial passage
of a work, by any of the three masters just mentioned, or by
any of their contemporaries or near pupils, has come down to us,
save in the case of one pupil of Zenodotus, more famous even
than his master, the grammarian Aristophanes. Criticism
indeed, it has been said, has, of all literature that is really
literature, the most precarious existence. Still, we know a
good deal about them from citations, allusions, and discussions
in later writers, while of Aristophanes of Byzantium we have
a fairly considerable collection of fragments.</p>

<p class='c001'>The disappearance of texts, always lamentable, if not actually
irremediable, is here more to be regretted than anywhere, because
there is fair reason for believing that, at any rate, some
of these grammarians were critics in the full and proper sense
of the term. By far the greater part of their labours appears to
have been directed to Homer, and there is no reason to contradict
the general, the received, opinion that while the Pisistratean
redaction is not quite certain in fact, and almost entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>unknown in nature, while it is certain that even Aristotle
had before him a text differing remarkably from our own,
the Alexandrian grammarians practically produced that which
we have. It is accordingly from this time that the famous
and formidable craft—science it would no doubt call itself—of
textual criticism may be said to date; and from our information,
second-hand as it is, we are enabled to recognise some types of
textual critics which are not, and are never likely to be, obsolete.
In Aristophanes, the spelling reformer, the practical originator
of accents, it is not rash to see the great exemplar of the critic
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their Four Masters.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of the purely philological kind, who busies himself
with those literary matters which are most remote
from literature proper, though no doubt he is a very valuable
person when he is kept in his proper place. Zenodotus stands
in the same relation to the lexicographical critic, and seems
also to have been the father of all those who by “a critical
text” mean a text arranged at their own discretion, passages
being expunged, transposed, or corrected, not in accordance
with any testimony as to what the author did write, but according
to the critic’s idea of what he ought to have written—in
other words, what the critic himself would have liked him to
write, or would, if he could, have written in his place. Aristarchus
appears to have deserved the primacy generally
accorded to him by being more wisely conservative than
Zenodotus, and less tempted to stick in the letter than the
lesser Aristophanes; as well as by a general display, in his more
literary remarks, of critical faculty greater than was possessed
by either, and infinitely greater than that of the average
scholiast. While the still earlier, and at least equally famous
or notorious, name of Zoilus is of itself sufficient to show that
the critic who is merely or mainly a snarler can at least boast
that he is of an ancient house.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be rash to deny, and even unjust to doubt, that
some of these famous critics, as well as others less known or
not known at all, practised criticism in its best and widest
sense, regulating texts by a sanely conservative acuteness,
interpreting meanings and purpose with adaptable but not too
fantastic compliance, annotating matter with intelligent erudition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>and even achieving, as best they could, the explanation
of the nature and success of their author’s literary appeal, and
the placing of his work in the general map of literary history.
Nay, there were actually, though our remains of them are but
tantalising, literary historians of tolerably old date. But it
is possibly neither presumptuous nor ungenerous to suspect
that, if we had the whole works of Aristarchus before us, we
should find in him (allowing for his grammatical tendency) at
least as much shortcoming as we found, probably far more
than we found, in Aristotle from the rhetorical side. For the
old disability—the absence of comparison, the possession
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Scholiasts on
Aristophanes.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of not even a second literature for purposes
of contrast—must have weighed upon Aristarchus
just as it weighed upon Aristotle. And it is at any rate not
uncharitable, it is merely a plain recognition of actual fact, to
say that on the great mass of Greek grammatical criticism, as
it comes down to us in the so-called scholiasts, the curse of
the letter does undoubtedly rest. Nothing, for instance, is
more curious than to read, from the critical point of view, the
Scholia on Aristophanes,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c008'><sup>[79]</sup></a> some of which are undoubtedly
among the oldest that we have on any author, except Homer.
The commentators are irreproachable in noting the slightest
grammatical peculiarity; they map out the metres with religious
care. Difficulties of mere meaning they tackle with
the same imperturbable seriousness, the same grave and chaste
attention to duty, whether the <em>crux</em> is a recondite “excursion
into the <em>blue</em>,” or a mystery of the kitchen and the fishmarket,
or a piece of legal technicality. They give careful and useful
abstracts and arguments, dates now and then, sometimes not
contemptible scraps of literary history. But of literary criticism
proper, of appreciation of Aristophanes' ever fresh wit, of
his astonishing intellectual alertness, of his wide knowledge,
of his occasional bursts of magnificent poetry, there is not one
word. You may spend hours, days, weeks almost over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>huge collection; but the result will only be that, for this special
purpose, page after page will be drawn blank.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it may be said, “The scholia on Aristophanes are confessedly<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c008'><sup>[80]</sup></a>
poor in literary annotation. Why do you take them
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Sophocles.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as an example? Why not take in preference, or
give in addition, one at least of those collections of
scholia which the same authorities<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c008'><sup>[81]</sup></a> accept as richer in the
matter?” Very well: let us take those on Sophocles,<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c008'><sup>[82]</sup></a> the
admittedly richest of all. It will—or certainly may—seem at
the opening as if a more promising “pocket” had been struck,
for the first annotation on the <cite>Ajax</cite> is busy with the arrangement
and contents of the prologue, and its relation to what
follows; and there is a good deal of similar matter throughout
the commentary on this play at least. But when we come to
read it in detail we find that its criticism is, at its widest departure
from the mere explanatory <i>supellex</i> of the ordinary
scholiast, almost purely <em>theatrical</em>. For instance, here is the
note on 66: “The introduction of Ajax is persuasive; for thus
the pathos of the tragedy becomes greater, the spectators
perceiving him now out of his mind, and a little later in
his senses.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And again on 112: “He speaks as in other respects yielding
to the goddess but in this opposing her, and the poet hence
shows his disposition to be haughty (since the spectators are
much disposed in favour of Ajax by his misfortunes, and all but
wroth with the poet), that Ajax may seem to suffer justly from
his want of submission to the divinity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We might quote the long and curious note on 134 as to the
composition of the chorus from Salaminians; the criticism of
the expostulation of the said chorus with the conduct of the
Greeks to Ajax, <a href='#Page_158'>158</a>; the still odder note on 201, as of one expounding
to a very little school-child how Tecmessa and the
Chorus exchange information; the formal explanation, on 342,
why Teucer is introduced later than Tecmessa, and of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>hero’s language to his captive mistress; the rationale, 770, of
the arrival of the messenger; the description of the scene at
815. But the mere enumeration of such things as these should,
without the expenditure of more space, be sufficient to show
what the character of this annotation is. It is not so very
different in places from the elaborate stage directions with
which, for the last century, some playwrights, especially German
and Scandinavian, have been wont to assist the imagination
of their readers or hearers, or their own dramatic incapacity;
and even when it goes beyond this, it hardly ever goes
further than the explanation and justification of the <em>action</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same is, I think, almost without exception the character
of the relatively considerable number of observations of a critical
kind which I have noted on other plays. Sometimes they are
actual directions to the actor—who is told on <cite>Electra</cite> 823 that
he “ought, at the moment of uttering the cry, to look up to
heaven, and raise his hands”—sometimes, as on <cite>Œdipus Tyrannus</cite>
141, the note is made that “this will stir the theatre.”
But always, I think,—certainly in the vast majority of cases,—the
critic abstains, with a rigidity which can only come from
deliberate purpose (and this is unlikely), or from unconsciousness
that the thing is likely to be required of him, from any
comments on the beauty or appropriateness of the verse, on the
idiosyncrasy of the phrase or its agreement with others, on the
Sophoclean characteristics of the poetry, or even (except from
the pure stage point of view) on the evolution of the characters.
He has evidently learnt his Aristotle, and looks at the action
first: he has not learnt him with a sufficiently independent
intelligence to remember that even Aristotle does not look at
the action only.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the case becomes strongest when we come to what should
be the stronghold of literary criticism in this quarter—the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Homer.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Scholia<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c008'><sup>[83]</sup></a> on Homer himself. Here we have the
thrice—nay, thirty times—decocted essence of the
critical study of generations, centuries, almost millennia (certainly
more than one millennium), of study of the writer who
entered into Greek life, Greek thought, Greek education, as no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>book, save the English Bible, has ever entered into the life,
the thought, the education, of any other country. We have it
in ample bulk, of all ages, presented in that special fashion of
comment on comment, of annotated annotation, which, whatever
may be its merits or whatever may be its drawbacks, is at
any rate suited to draw out examination of the common subject
from almost every point of view.</p>

<p class='c001'>And what do we find in this? We find, of course, verbal
explanation in floods, in oceans, sometimes of the most valueless,
often of the most valuable kind. We find laborious comment
on etymology (not quite so often valuable as eccentric),
on grammar (invaluable often), on mythology, &amp;c., &amp;c., giving
us what, whether it be artistically worthy or worthless, we
often could not otherwise by any possibility know. We get
the most painstaking, if not always the most illuminative or
illuminated, discussions of the poet’s meaning, handled simply,
handled allegorically, handled “this way, that way, which way
you please.” Not seldom, as elsewhere (in Eustathius, for
instance), we get certain references to Figures and the technical
rules of Rhetoric, which touch the outer skirts, the fringes, of
literary criticism itself. But of that criticism, as represented
even in Dionysius, much more in Longinus, the allowance is
astonishingly small. You may read page after page, volume
after volume, and find absolutely nothing, or next to nothing, of
the sort. Take, for instance, the two volumes of Scholia on the
<cite>Odyssey</cite>, as published by Dindorf—on the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, the very
touchstone of all Greek literature for literary criticism, and one
which proves the gold in Longinus at the very moment that it
shows what we may think not so golden in him. You turn and
turn. Besides the matter classified above, a great many extremely
valuable, or at worst more or less curious, thoughts
meet you. You will be informed (on Od. ii. 99) that “It is
natural to women to dislike the parents of their husbands”;
on vi. 137, that “All youth is fearful because of its want of experience,
but especially female youth.” You will find examples
of the puerile quibbling of Zoilus, such as that it was unlikely
that exactly six sailors were taken from each ship; with the
common-sense, if not much less puerile, retort that it is difficult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>to get ἑβδομήκοντα δύο into verse. But such things are no
great windfall; and such others as the observation, at 391 of
the same book, on the poet’s wonderful faculty and daring in
making the sound suit the sense, and of showing in that sound
“all the sorrow of the sight,” are very rare. They still more
rarely soar above observations on special points, or reach criticism
of general handling of the relations of one part of the story
to another, of its pervading poetical quality and charm. For
one note, vol. i. p. 425, a little farther on, as to the variety and
aptness of the Homeric compound epithets for beasts, we shall
find pages and sheets of mere trifling. And when we get a
more thoughtful examination (see, for instance, that given as
apparently Porphyry’s in the Appendix, ii. 789, on the conduct
of Ulysses in selecting the persons to whom he shall first
reveal himself), it strikes one at once that these, like the
comments above cited on the <cite>Ajax</cite>, are comments on the
<em>action</em>, on the dramatic structure, and not on the literary
execution.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the same—it is perhaps even more the same—if we
turn to the <cite>Iliad</cite>. The famous first words elicit naturally
a good deal<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c008'><sup>[84]</sup></a> of comment, which has some promise. Why
did he begin with “wrath,” which is an ill-sounding word?
For two reasons. First, that he might purify the corresponding
part of the souls of his readers by the passions, &amp;c.
Secondly, that he might give his “praises of the Greeks”
greater verisimilitude. Besides, this was the practical subject
with which he was first to deal as in a kind of tragic prologue.
Then there is an odd gradation of the states of wrath itself,
from ὀργὴ to μῆνις. Next, an inquiry why the poet begins
with the end of the war, and so forth. This, of course, is
literary criticism of a sort, but on thin and threadbare lines
enough; and there is not very much even of this. The
scholiasts are far more at home with accentuation and punctuation;
with the endless question of <i>athetesis</i> (or blackmarking,
as spurious); with such technical ticketings as at i. 366: “The
trope is <i>anakephalaiosis</i>.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c008'><sup>[85]</sup></a> There are four kinds of narrative—homiletic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>apangeltic, hypostatic,<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c008'><sup>[86]</sup></a> and mixed”; or with such
curiously unintelligent attempts to pin down poetic beauty
as the note at i. 477 on ῥοδοδάκτυλος as a synecdoche,
in which, by the way, even the colour-scheme seems to be
misunderstood.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the close of these remarks on the Scholiasts I must enter
in a fresh form the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>caveat</i></span> which has perhaps been wearisomely
iterated, but which it is better to repeat too often than to
suppress even in a single place where its omission might
mislead. I am not finding fault with these laborious and
invaluable persons for not doing what they had not the least
intention to do. I am not (Heaven forbid!) arguing for any
superiority in the modern critic over the ancient. I am only
endeavouring to show that the subjects to which modern
literary critics—who, as it seems to me, stick to their business
most closely, and abstain most from metabasis ἐς ἄλλο
γένος—pay most attention, were precisely those to which
ancient critics, as a matter of fact, paid least. And this
it is not only the right but the duty of the historian to
point out.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor will it, I trust, while we are thus examining Miscellanea,
be considered frivolous or superfluous to examine
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>The Literary Epigrams of the Anthology.</cite><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that vast mass of information on Greek life and
thought after the Golden Age which is called the
<cite>Greek Anthology</cite>,<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c008'><sup>[87]</sup></a> to see whether it can afford us
any light. In this mass, with its thousands of
articles ranging from exquisite to contemptible in actual
literary quality, the range of subject is notoriously as wide
as that of merit. The devotees of the Minor Muses of Hellas
will “rhyme,” as we should say, anything from a riddle and
an arithmetical conundrum, to Myron’s cow and the complimentary
statues to the latest fashionable athlete. It would
be odd, therefore, if books and authors escaped or were ignored,
and they duly appear. In the battalions of <i>adespota</i>, besides a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>stray versification<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c008'><sup>[88]</sup></a> of the rules for making iambics, and a wail<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c008'><sup>[89]</sup></a>
from some grammarian unnamed that he cannot write as well
as Palladius or Palladas, we come to a considerable body<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c008'><sup>[90]</sup></a> of
literary epigrams arranged, by some one or other of the
numerous ancient editors of the <cite>Anthology</cite>, in vaguely chronological
order of subject. First, as in duty bound, come Linus
and Orpheus, then a considerable batch on Homer, and then
the long succession of poets and philosophers, dramatists and
historians, to follow. For the most part, of course, the epigrams
contain generalities and commonplaces, but with more or less
of the neatness and prettiness that we associate with the very
name of the <cite>Anthology</cite>; sometimes they go a little closer
to the matter, as in the piece (523 of Jacobs) on Erinna’s much-praised
“Distaff.” As we have only five<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c008'><sup>[91]</sup></a> (and those not consecutive)
out of the three hundred verses which this girl of
nineteen years composed, it would be rash as well as unkind
to question the judgment of the epigrammatist that they are
“equal to Homer.” But it may safely be said that the judgment
itself is in a rudimentary style of criticism. It is natural, but
rather “tell-tale,” that the critic-poets always, when they can,
take some non-literary point—Anacreon’s fondness for wine,
the equality in number of the Muses and the books of
Herodotus, the supposed physical and moral shortcomings
of Aristotle, and the like. But sometimes they go higher.
There is plenty of spirit and sense in the epigram on Panætius
for pronouncing the <cite>Phædo</cite> spurious,—as is well known, this
idlest of critical debauches was at least as great a favourite
with the ancients as with the moderns (548). Sometimes we
get valuable testimony as to popular judgments—the unfeigned
admiration which was felt for Menander, though
the sounder critics might put him below Aristophanes; the
mighty repute of Aristides of Smyrna (see p. 113) who is
pretty certainly <em>not</em> the Aristides congratulated ironically in
another epigram as never having less than seven auditors—the
four walls of the room, and the three benches in it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Perhaps Claudian is a little overparted with the “mind of
Virgil and the Muse of Homer.” But all decadences are given
to exaggeration of this kind; and the reviews of the closing
years of the nineteenth century in England will furnish much
more extravagant instances of comparison.</p>

<p class='c001'>The work of known, or at least named, individuals is less
noteworthy in bulk, and not much more so in kind and degree.
The right happy industry of Meleager appears to have helped
in preserving for us no small proportion of the minor work
of the great men of old. But his own quintessenced and not
seldom charming pen is devoted to subjects always less solemn,
and sometimes very much less worthy, than literature. These
elders themselves (as indeed we should expect) meddle with
literature but rarely; while their successors, the early Alexandrians,
are less copious than we might have expected.
Simmias of Thebes (perhaps not the same who outraged<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c008'><sup>[92]</sup></a> the
feelings of neo-classic critics, from Addison downwards, two
thousand years later, by composing verse-eggs and -hatchets)
has left us a couple of elegant and regular, though rather vague
and slight, epigrams on Sophocles;<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c008'><sup>[93]</sup></a> Philiscus of Miletus, who
was at least old enough to be a pupil of Isocrates, a pompous
eulogium of Lysias;<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c008'><sup>[94]</sup></a> while no less a person than Thucydides
has the credit of one<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c008'><sup>[95]</sup></a> on the Third Tragedian, which if extravagant
in tone is neat in expression. Of the compliments<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c008'><sup>[96]</sup></a>
to Aristophanes and Sappho, which are similarly attributed
to Plato, the former, with its consecration of the soul of the
great comic poet as the <i>temenos</i> of the Graces, is far the better.
But the nearest approach to literature among the verses attributed
to Plato’s mightiest rival is a quaint bundle (no small
one)<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c008'><sup>[97]</sup></a> of epitaphs on the Homeric heroes. Of course these
attributions are in all cases very doubtful, and possibly not
in a single one correct; but the fact of them for literary history
remains the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we turn to others, we shall draw some of the most flourishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>coverts in vain, but find something elsewhere. Erycius of
Cyzicus<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c008'><sup>[98]</sup></a> has a spirited retort to an insulter of Homer, and a
generous eulogium of Sophocles—it is noteworthy that these
two most unite the Anthological, as the general, suffrage.
Palladas handles Homer’s dealings with women,<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c008'><sup>[99]</sup></a> elsewhere<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c008'><sup>[100]</sup></a>
jests ruefully about having to sell his books, even Callimachus
and Pindar, and moralises<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c008'><sup>[101]</sup></a> the story of Circe, rather stupidly,
but in a fashion for which he might find only too many compurgators
in antiquity. Pollianus<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c008'><sup>[102]</sup></a> rallies (not disagreeably)
the stealers of Homeric tags and phrases; and a certain Cyrus
accomplishes<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c008'><sup>[103]</sup></a> a mild couplet to complete his own witty conceit
of erecting a statue of Pindar at a bath. The long and curious
poem<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c008'><sup>[104]</sup></a> of Christodorus Coptites on the statues in the Gymnasium
of Zeuxippus naturally has a great many literary
allusions. Agathias—a somewhat major star than most of
these, and one whose pursuits earned him the special surname
of Scholasticus—has, so far as I remember, only two literary
epigrams<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c008'><sup>[105]</sup></a> on statues of Æsop and Plutarch. Another
“Scholasticus,” scarcely distinguished more by the name of
Thomas, announces that he has three “stars in rhetoric”—Demosthenes,
Aristides, and Thucydides<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c008'><sup>[106]</sup></a>—praising especially
the pains of the first, but seeming actually to prefer the two
latter. Leon, the philosopher, has a little handful<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c008'><sup>[107]</sup></a> of epigrams
on books, chiefly of science and philosophy, and a Homeric
cento not more respectable than such things usually are.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great name of Theocritus is attached<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c008'><sup>[108]</sup></a> to pieces, not inelegant
but very distinctly <em>banal</em>, on Anacreon, Epicharmus,
Archilochus, Hipponax; and that of the lesser Alcæus (not
the great one of Mitylene, but the much lesser Messenian) to
some praises of Homer,<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c008'><sup>[109]</sup></a> of Hesiod,<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c008'><sup>[110]</sup></a> and again of Hipponax.
Dioscorides<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c008'><sup>[111]</sup></a> extols Sappho, defends the much-injured Philænis
against those who (to judge from confirmatory testimony to the
same effect elsewhere) played upon her the same ignoble trick
by which a certain Frenchman, in days nearer our own, tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>to blast the fair fame of Luisa Sigea of Toledo. He is complimentarily
orthodox as to Sophocles, but not much less complimentary
to Sositheus, of whom we know little, and to Macho,
of whom, thanks to Athenæus, we know that he exercised his
wits upon putting naughty anecdotes into uncommonly pedestrian
verse. An epigram of the Grammarian Crates<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c008'><sup>[112]</sup></a> refers
to the controversy on the respective merits of Ch&oelig;rilus, Antimachus,
and Homer, and would have been very welcome if
it had given us some information on that matter; but as it
is, the subject is a mere pretext to enable Crates to “talk
greasily.” Antipater of Sidon,<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c008'><sup>[113]</sup></a> starting from the childish
debate about the birthplace of Homer, turns it into something
better by his conclusion—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thy country is great Heaven: there was to thee</div>
      <div class='line'>No mortal mother, but Calliope”;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>and he subsequently celebrates Sappho, “Erinna of few verses,”
and Pindar, returning to the same subjects (except Erinna) in
another batch, and adding a group on Anacreon (who, as fertile
in commonplaces, is a favourite subject of the Anthologians),
Stesichorus, and Ibycus.</p>

<p class='c001'>At least three epigrams of a different sort rather make us
regret that there are not more of the same kind, instead of the
iteration of stock phrases. The first,<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c008'><sup>[114]</sup></a> by Herodicus of Babylon,
is a smart onslaught on the “fry of Aristarchus,” the “mono-syllabists”
who care for nothing but ΣΦΙΝ and ΣΦΩιΝ  and ΜΙΝ
and ΝΙΝ. The second,<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c008'><sup>[115]</sup></a> by Antiphanes, hails the “busybody
race” of grammarians who “dig up the roots of other people’s
muses,” with a great many more abusive but not quite inappropriate
epithets and comparisons. The third,<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c008'><sup>[116]</sup></a> by Philippus, is
perhaps the best of the three, girding at the “whelps of Zenodotus”
with a kind of combination of the other two, which is
very likely actual and intentional. Philip (<i>v. infra</i>) was a
careful student of the elders of his craft. Antipater of Thessalonica<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c008'><sup>[117]</sup></a>
has quite a group of literary epigrams. He celebrates
the Nine Poetesses, takes part in the Antimachus-Homer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>debate, refusing the Colophonian primacy, but granting him
second rank and the praise of rough vigour (“the Hammer on
the anvil of the Pierides”), &amp;c., and honours Aristophanes.
Homer once more occupies Alpheus of Mitylene<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c008'><sup>[118]</sup></a> and Antiphilus
of Byzantium,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c008'><sup>[119]</sup></a> while Philippus of Thessalonica<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c008'><sup>[120]</sup></a> devotes
a “pretty but slim” comparison with flowers to the principal
bards of the Anthology itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>This same Philippus has also a not unhappy conceit<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c008'><sup>[121]</sup></a> about
Hipponax bidding the usual passer-by at his tomb “not wake
the sleeping wasp, Whose shafts fly straight although his metres
limp.” A pale addition to the garland of Sophocles comes
from the doubtless alien hand of Stratyllius Flaccus,<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c008'><sup>[122]</sup></a> and
Hesiod supplies only a play on words to the better artistry of
Marcus Argentarius,<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c008'><sup>[123]</sup></a> while the accident of our order of reading—a
genuine accident—finishes a volume, and the tale, with
the marvellously lame and only epigram of a certain Pinytus<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c008'><sup>[124]</sup></a>
on no less a person than Sappho.</p>

<p class='c001'>A very thankless wretch would he be who was not grateful
for any legitimate excuse to wander once more through the
length and breadth of the enchanted gardens of the Anthology.
But the reperusal can only strengthen the opinion already
formed that on the actual “evaluation of π” in criticism the
Greek mind, whether wisely or unwisely, was not strongly set.
Nothing can be clearer than that the forms, the range, the
etiquette, so to speak, of the compositions which are here
grouped, invited criticism in the graver way as thorough as
that which Ben Jonson gives to Shakespeare, Camden, and a
dozen others; in the lighter as sharp, and at the same time as
piercing, as that of Piron on La Chaussée. But it was not
the mode, and they were not in the vein. With rare exceptions
they obeyed the classical principle of taking the accepted, the
obvious, the orthodox, and dressing it up in their best way. It
by no means follows that they were not right; but it does
follow that they leave us a little unsatisfied. To tell us that
Homer is great, Sappho lofty, Sophocles perfect, Aristophanes
witty, is (to use the old comparison of George Gascoigne) to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>praise the “crystal eye” and the “cherry lip” of any gentle-woman.
And so we may turn to the division of Greek literature
most opposite to the Anthology itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before considering in some, at least, representative detail the
vast and arid province of the technical Greek Rhetoric, it may be
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Rhetoric of the Schools.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
well, or rather is absolutely necessary, to resume the
consideration of what Rhetoric really meant. As
we have seen, it was at the beginning a strictly practical Art of
Persuasion by Oratory; and if it tended to embrace and absorb
all or most other arts and sciences, this was partly because the
orator would certainly have to deal with many, and might have
to deal with all, of these, partly because it was always more or
less a political art, an art of public business. For the Greek
politician, like others, was expected to be a Jack-of-all-trades.</p>

<p class='c001'>But even while this practical object continued, the Greek
passion for abstracting and refining tended to turn practice into
theory, while the Greek love of sport, competition, public display,
tended further to turn this theory into the code of a very
elaborate game. Obviously enough, as the practical importance
of oratory declined, the technical and “sporting” interest of
Rhetoric got more and more the upper hand. Rhetoricians
specialised their terminology, multiplied their classifications,
and drew their rules ever finer and finer, just as croquet-players
narrow their hoops and bulge out their balls, just as whist-players
split and wire-draw the broad general principles of the
play of Deschapelles and Clay into “American leads,” and an
endless reverberation of “calls” and “echoes.” We possess a
very large, and a more curious than interesting, collection of the
technical writings of this half craft, half sport, and a collection,
rather less in proportion, but a little more interesting, of
examples of the finished handiwork or game. To both of these
we must now turn, premising that the technical part has not
very much, and the finished examples surprisingly little, to
furnish to the stricter literature of our subject. Why, then, do
we deal with it? Because even abused Rhetoric is always
Literary Criticism in a more or less degraded and disguised
condition. The degradation can be remedied, the disguise
thrown off, whenever the hour and the man arrive. Rhetoric, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>her worst moods, keeps the tools ready, keeps them almost too
sharply ground, if she does not put them to the right use.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Rhetoric preserved her authority not merely to the latest
classical times but right through the Middle Ages, and even at
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its documents.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the close of the latter escaped, at the cost only of
some minor changes and additions, the decay which
fell upon the rest of Scholastic learning, it is not surprising
that the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Rhetores Græci</cite></span> received early attention from the
young art of Printing. Had not Aldus, in 1508-1509, collected
them in two folio volumes, it is perhaps rather unlikely that we
should have had any more modern collections at all. For
technical Rhetoric fell into even more disfavour than Logic with
the rise of physical science and materialist philosophy in the
seventeenth century; and though, in some applied senses of the
word, it has never fallen into complete disuse, it has never, as
Logic has, recovered position in its stricter and more formal
forms. It was therefore no small feat, even of German industry,
when, some seventy years ago, Christian Walz of Tübingen undertook
a new edition,<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c008'><sup>[125]</sup></a> which, though some additions and improvements
have since been made by Spengel<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c008'><sup>[126]</sup></a> and others, remains
the main standard and thesaurus. Its ten stout volumes, of
some seven thousand closely printed pages, have probably been
read through, and line by line, by hardly a single person for
each decade of the seven during which it has been before the
world. For not only is the bulk enormous, but the matter is
extremely technical; there is endless repetition, commentaries
on commentaries on commentaries forming no small part of the
whole, while the minute definition and special terminology<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c008'><sup>[127]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>require extremely careful reading. I shall not pretend to have
read every word of it myself; but I have read a very great
deal of it, and everything that follows can be guaranteed as
drawn at first hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>The original treatises of the collection form its smallest
part, and none of them is very early; indeed, of the earlier
formal Rhetoric, as has been said, Aristotle is almost our only
representative, though, luckily, he is worth all the others. If
the περὶ ἑρμηνείας, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Interpretatione</cite></span>, which goes by the name
of Demetrius, had been rightly referred (in accordance with
nearly all the MSS., as far as the name goes, and with the
assent of so distinguished and acute a scholar as Petrus
Victorius in regard to the person) to Demetrius of Phalerus,—the
Athenian statesman and orator of the latter half of the
fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, the antagonist of his namesake the City-Taker
and lover of Lamia, the scholar of Theophrastus, the
schoolfellow of Menander, the probable consulting founder of
the Alexandrian library—its interest of authorship would be
only inferior to that of the work of the greatest writers. But
the allusions and citations in the treatise itself (unless we
suppose it to have been edited and interpolated to an extent
such as to make it useless as a document) are such as to put
this attribution out of the question. And while Dionysius and
others have been put forward as possible claimants, there
seems no reason to doubt that the most probable author is to
be found in some Alexandrian grammarian or sophist of the
name of Demetrius (perhaps the one actually named by Diogenes
Laertius as having written rhetorical treatises), who may have
lived under the Antonines. There is, therefore, no reason for
disturbing Walz’s actual order.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c008'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>His first volume is composed of divers more or less original
treatises, which are of the kind called προγυμνάσματα, “Preliminary
Exercises,” and which in most cases actually bear that
title. The first is by the famous Hermogenes (<i>ob.</i> <i>c.</i> 170 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the Ph&oelig;nix of rhetoricians pure and simple, who became a
master at fifteen and an idiot at five-and-twenty, whose “heart
was covered with hair,” and whose works not only followed
him, but were followed by libraries-full of scholiasts and commentators.
The next, itself a sort of adaptation of Hermogenes,
is by Aphthonius of Antioch, a teacher of the beginning of the
fourth century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, who had the rather curious good fortune
not merely to secure a long vogue in the late classical ages, but
to be current in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Theon, an Alexandrian, but not the father of Hypatia, follows,
with the less-known names of Nicolas, Nicephorus, Adrian,
Severus, and the better known George Pachymeres, as well
as another collection by an anonym. Of these, the works
attributed to Adrian and Severus are not called προγυμνάσματα,
but in the first case μελέται, in the second διηγήματα καὶ
ἠθοποΐαι.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c008'><sup>[129]</sup></a> The most famous and popular of the sets, those of
Hermogenes and Aphthonius, are very short, and, like that of
Georgius Pachymeres, do not exceed fifty pages. The others
are longer, and in the case of the work of Nicolas, some three
times as long.</p>

<p class='c001'>The opening of the Progymnasmata of Hermogenes is a
curious and slightly bewildering mixture of definition, literary
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Progymnasmata <i>of Hermogenes</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
history, and the kind of “Manual for Young
Writers” (<i>lege</i> orators), which, after long disuse, has
recently begun to be prepared for the aspiring
journalist. The first chapter is on Fables. They are supposed
to be good things for the young. They have various authors
and titles, but there is a tendency to give the name of Æsop
to all of them. They are not true to fact; but should be
plausible, and can be made so by suiting the action to the
characters and making the peacock stand for beauty and
vanity, the fox for wisdom, the ape for mimicry. Sometimes
you should give them shortly, sometimes spin them out.
(Example given.) You may put them in different places of
your speech, and they will do instead of an actual example.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second chapter is of Narration (διήγημα), which is distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>from Fable as being the story of something which
has either actually happened or is told as if it had. Homer and
Herodotus are both “narrators.” There are five kinds of it
(one thinks of Polonius)—the directly declaratory, the indirectly
ditto, the elenchtic, the loose, the periodic—with examples of
each kind.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c008'><sup>[130]</sup></a> The first is good for story, the second for debate,
“the elenchtic [confuting] is rather for elenchs,” and the loose
for epilogues, as being pathetic.</p>

<p class='c001'>We might at very little expense of trouble, if at much of
space, go through the whole of the little treatise and show
how the hairy-hearted one of Tarsus deals in the same
way with “Uses,”<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c008'><sup>[131]</sup></a> Maxims, Refutation and Confirmation,
Commonplace, Encomium, Comparison, Character-drawing,<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c008'><sup>[132]</sup></a>
Ecphrasis,<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c008'><sup>[133]</sup></a> Thesis,<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c008'><sup>[134]</sup></a> and Introduction. But the examples
given will suffice. Each chapter consists of a definition, a
division, sometimes very finely drawn, of kinds, examples,
and generally a scrap of advice as to how, when, and where
to introduce them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The good and the evil of this kind of thing, as well as its
special bearings on literary criticism, are not difficult to discern.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Remarks on them.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It necessitates the narrowest and most accurate
investigation of the kinds and characteristics of
literature, of literary means, of “composition,” in the wide and
the narrow sense. It confers on apt students, besides the mere
ability to play the special game of artificial oratory, a great
acuteness of analysis. It entirely avoids, no doubt, the danger
which is charged constantly, and sometimes not without a certain
justice, on the more æsthetic kind of literary study and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>literary criticism—the danger of desultory chatter. It has,
in short, though to a less degree, the virtues of Formal Logic.
And if the subject of Education, and fresh nostrums in it,
were not a weariness to all intelligent mankind, one might
say that not a few things in our present curricula might with
advantage be excluded to make room for a course (with some
due alterations) of Rhetoric according to Hermogenes. But,
at the same time, its own shortcomings and its own dangers
are equally obvious. The greatest of them—indeed one which
in a manner swallows up and contains within itself all the others—is
the almost irresistible temptation to regard literature as
something according to scheme and schedule, something that
the pocket ivory rule of the architect, and his neatly latticed
paper, and a short handbook like this before us, will enable
you to despatch and dispose of. Acute as are the divisions
and definitions, they are dead things; and nothing that imitates
and follows them can be really alive.</p>

<p class='c001'>Aphthonius adopts the same divisions of Progymnasmata,
save that he makes them fourteen instead of twelve, by
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Aphthonius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
separating ἀνασκευὴ [rebutting] from κατασκευὴ [confirming],
and adding a section on Blame. His object was evidently
to make even the business-like handling of
his predecessor more precise still; and the long and revived
popularity which, as has been said, he achieved, was not an
undue reward for one of the most craftsmanlike crambooks
that ever deserved the encomium of the epithet and the discredit
of the noun. Aphthonius substitutes for the simple
heading “Of Myth,” &amp;c., “<i>Definition</i> of Myth,” &amp;c.; and
though he still keeps his sections very short, he manages,
instead of the rather brachygraphic indication of examples in
the text, to give an appendix of complete if miniature pattern
at the end of each section—a fable of the ants and grasshoppers,
urging youth to industry, for the first; the story of the
rose and its acquiring redness from the blood of Aphrodite
when she struck her foot against its thorns in trying to shield
Adonis from Ares, for the second; and so on. In every respect,
Aphthonius has studied clearness, and he has certainly
achieved it. If it were not for the dangers of the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>method, and especially that greatest one, of encouraging the
mistake of classification for fact, terms for things, orderly
reference to a schedule for æsthetic appreciation, he would
deserve very hearty applause. And even as it is, one could,
as has been said above, see the study which he facilitates
substituted for any one of at least a dozen subjects of our
modern overcrowded curriculum with a great deal of equanimity.
Short as the piece is, some of the examples, such
as the encomia of Thucydides and of Wisdom, are compositions
of considerable finish. But it is significant that in the
first there is, strictly speaking, no literary criticism at all, and
that even the inevitable comparison with Herodotus is poorly
shuffled off with the stock reproach that Herodotus writes to
please, Thucydides to speak the truth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Theon, with greater space at his command, employs a different
method. It is uncertain whether he preceded or followed
<span class='sni side3'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Theon.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Aphthonius; but the former theory is favoured by
the fact that he, like Hermogenes, has twelve subjects
only, those which Aphthonius put asunder being still
united. He begins with a general disquisition on, and encomium
of, the Progymnasmata, widening them somewhat, so as to
bring in Figures to some extent, but also describing some of
these as “contentious” or “disputed.” Then he has a rather
curious chapter, nearer to our special purpose than usual,
showing how, not merely the great orators, but the great
writers of old, used these forms, or rather things which can
be brought under these forms, citing the famous speech of
Sophocles as to his emancipation from love in the <cite>Republic</cite>,
the fable of the flute-player in Herodotus, others in other
historians, and a very great many more things, not a few
of which are lost. This enumeration is not only interesting
as pointing to these <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>desiderata</i></span>, but as showing how unhappy
the Greek was unless he could arrange and classify and
ticket, as well as, distinguish and enjoy, the parts and characteristics
of literature. The spirit is not dead yet: it has
prompted a much-respected living author on Rhetoric to
describe <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>In Memoriam</cite></span> as “a combined Hyperbole of Affection
and Sorrow.” And this may undoubtedly be said in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>favour, that its exercise does really require and promote a
certain intellectual alertness and activity. But the question
is, Do this alertness and this activity exert themselves in
actual progress, or in mere marking-time? Is the comprehension
(one can hardly even ask Is the enjoyment) of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>In
Memoriam</cite></span> furthered by its orderly arrangement in the case
generally labelled “Hyperbole,” and in the compartment
labelled “Combined Hyperboles,” and in the further pigeon-hole
labelled “Of Affection and Sorrow”? Is it really important
to decide whether Sophocles’s variation on “sour grapes” is
a χρεία or an apophthegm, and which are the most remarkable
examples of διήγημα in the orators and the historians respectively?
Such things may appear to some specially and fatally
to underlie the Platonic curse on the appearance of knowledge
without the reality. But they have, as we see, very strong
and long prescription, and there are still some who bitterly
resent the exclusion of them from the teaching, not merely of
technical Rhetoric, but of literature—who regard a system
of “leaden rules,” of individual appreciation without classes
and compartments and indorsements, as dilettante, unscientific
(which it would certainly allow itself to be), and effeminate.
Between the two, opinion, a little assisted by Logic and
History, must be left to decide.</p>

<p class='c001'>Theon’s handling of the Progymnasmata (which he often
speaks of without the <i>pro</i>) is, as has been said, much fuller
than those of Hermogenes and Aphthonius. He does not, like
the latter of these, give a regular formal pattern of each kind;
but he has a great many illustrative references to literature,
and he has a good deal of discussion on what may be called the
philosophy of the several kinds. Nor is it unnoteworthy that
in dealing with Commonplace he drops the “common,” substitutes
<i>prosopop&oelig;ia</i> for <i>ethop&oelig;ia</i>, and introduces the curious
new heading of “Law.” On the whole, Theon is more “for
thoughts” than either of his forerunners;<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c008'><sup>[135]</sup></a> he might profit a
clever boy more, and he has much more numerous and deeper
glimmerings of insight into the purely critical side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>matter. But he lacks system, and this, in dealing with a
subject which is systematic or nothing, is a drawback.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a rhetorical Nicolaus (indeed the name was very
common) who was a student of Proclus; but the author of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Nicolaus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<cite>Progymnasmata</cite> we possess seems to have flourished
later, under the Emperor Leo and after him. For
some reason or none, MSS. of him seem to be specially found
at Oxford. They are merely examples, several of each kind,
and sometimes minutely subdivided, there being, for instance,
separate patterns of mixed, unmixed, logical, and practical
“Use.” They form, in fact, a curious bundle, and by no means
a very small one, of partial declamations in common form,
the examples of <cite>Ethopœia</cite> being especially remarkable: “What
sort of things Niobe would say,” “What Menœceus the patriotic
suicide,” “What Cassandra at the sight of the horse,” &amp;c.
No less than fourteen in all are given.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is also the principle of the <cite>Progymnasmata</cite> of Nicephorus
Basilicus, a notary (not the son-in-law chronicled by
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Nicephorus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Scott) of Alexius Comnenus, who gives no less than
three-and-twenty Ethop&oelig;iæ on subjects Pagan and
Christian. In fact, these two collections, which together fill
some two hundred and fifty well-packed pages, may be regarded
rather as rhetorical reading-books, designedly intended to possess
a certain interest, than as anything else. Familiarity with
them would be likely to produce much the same sort of literary
facility, and in a sense “correctness,” as that which we find in
the minor French writers of the eighteenth century. It could,
after mere childhood (when it might insensibly inculcate some
good principles and some sound models), have little other good
effect.</p>

<p class='c001'>The few μελέται of Adrianus, the successor and funeral
eulogist of Herodes Atticus, are whole declamations, not
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Minors.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
brought under any of the heads. The <cite>Diegemata</cite>
and <cite>Ethop&oelig;iæ</cite> of Severus, after what has been said
of these kinds, will need no special characterisation; and the
<cite>Progymnasmata</cite> of George Pachymeres (who was nearly contemporary
with Dante) and of the Anonymus are, like so
many of the others, pure examples, indeed (as the former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>are well called in one MS.) <i>Meletæ</i> on the Progymnasmata
themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>No great resumption or amplification of the scattered comments
already made on these works can be necessary. They
form a by no means contemptible group of "Composition
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>General remarks on the Progymnasmata.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
books," creditably distinguished from some
more modern examples of the same kind by being
busy with something  better than  mere grammar,
but not as a rule showing any of that conception of style which
is visible as early as Dionysius, distinct in Quintilian, and
present in a form at once vigorous and exquisite in Longinus.
They are by no means ill calculated to excite an interest in
literature, and even to facilitate the production, in not contemptible
form, of certain kinds of it. But there is upon all of
them the curse of beginning at the wrong end—of constructing
an elaborate skeleton system of forms, and kinds, and sub-kinds,
and then classifying literature under these, instead of beginning
with the literature, separating the good from the bad, and examining,
as far as may be possible, the sources of goodness and
badness. A man trained in them would have many advantages
over our heaven-born, but hardly even earth-instructed, reviewers
and students of literature. But he would be very apt
to miss the finer touches, to lose the nobler gusts, of literature;
and he would be especially disposed towards that worst disease
of criticism, so often manifested in its history, which leads men
to ignore, or even blaspheme, great work, because it refuses to
be classified, or to obey the arbitrary rules which have been
foisted into, or encrusted upon, the classification.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not from such a point of view did the still later teachers,
who set themselves to comment on the comment of Hermogenes
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Commentaries on them.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and Aphthonius, regard their authorities. The
second volume of Walz—a stout one of  nearly
seven hundred pages—is entirely occupied with
scholia on Aphthonius alone, at the rate, that is to say, of
about fourteen pages of margent to one of text. This flood of
words about words has been too much for the patience even of
the editor, who gives specimens only of some, and in just wrath
labels one as “a futile opuscule botched together with utter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>stupidity.” Much, indeed, is of the usual kind which we associate
with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>scholia</cite></span>—verbal interpretation, sometimes not useless,
but as a rule singularly pedestrian and uninspired, introduced
with a monotonous rattle of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>clichés</i></span> and catchwords.
But there are also better things, and the so-called “Homilies” of
Doxopater, besides being of very considerable bulk (they fill
some four hundred pages, not of mere scrappy annotation but of
substantive commentary), attest the intelligence as well as the
industry of their author, a Byzantine of the eleventh century.
But they are (necessarily, no doubt) cribbed and cabined by
the circumscriptions of their text.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the third volume we return to comparatively original
work, with Hermogenes once more at the head of the authors.
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The "Art" of Hermogenes.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
We have left the vestibule—the Progymnasmata—and
are now in the main courts of pure Rhetoric
herself. Much more than half the volume is occupied
by the four divisions of the master’s <cite>Technic</cite>: the first of
“<i>Staseis</i>,” the second, in four parts, of “Inventions,” the third
of “Ideas,” and the fourth of “Cleverness<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c008'><sup>[136]</sup></a> of Method.” One
synopsis of about a hundred pages, an anonymous epitome of
fifty, with eleven shorter epitomes, and other tractates, scarcely
averaging a dozen pages each, complete the volume.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no doubt that the manual of Hermogenes is the text-book
of later Greek Rhetoric. Five mortal volumes of Walz,
one of nearly nine hundred pages, are occupied by scholia upon
it, two of these being devoted to the <i>Staseis</i> alone; and it seems
to have been the model subject even of those who did not ostensibly
range themselves as its commentators. The book of the
<i>Staseis</i>, which produced fifteen hundred pages of extant and
printed commentary, has itself but fifty or sixty, the great bulk
of the treatise being contained under the heads of “Inventions”
and “Ideas.” There is a table of contents, but it may be
feared that this will be of but partial service to any one not
acquainted with the technicalities of the subject. Others may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>indeed be relieved by the names of well-known Greek orators
and historians, who appear to be discussed under “Ideas,” and
even by those of some commonly known Figures in the last
division. But on the whole Terminology revels in all her
wildest Greek luxuriance. Hypodiæresis and Prodiegesis guard
the labyrinth with Antenclema and Procatastasis<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c008'><sup>[137]</sup></a> ready at
hand; more familiar words have obviously assumed new senses;
and it is not even the very easiest thing to acquire a distinct
and satisfactory idea of the connotation of the great section-headings
themselves, while, when that idea is at last attained,
we may find that it is for our special purpose irrelevant, or
nearly so.</p>

<p class='c001'>The best instance stands, at the very threshold of the investigation,
in the very name of those <i>Staseis</i> which, as we have seen,
attracted the commentators as a candle does flies. Στάσις is
a term which appears impossible to translate into any single
English word, even in that legal vocabulary to which (far more
than to anything having to do with literature) it really belongs.
Its Latin equivalent is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>status</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>constitutio</i></span>:<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c008'><sup>[138]</sup></a> M. Egger
renders it in French as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>état de cause</i></span>; Liddell and Scott do not
attempt to render it at all; but it and its Latin equivalents
have been variously translated as “state of the case,” “issue,”
“point.” Sometimes it seems as if it might be not impossibly
translated “plea.” Hermogenes (who plunges at once, after his
fashion, into a wilderness of the most wiredrawn distinctions)
gives no general definition, but says that στάσις ὁρικὴ is “the
search for a name for a thing,” and instances the case of a man
who has stolen the private property of a priest. Is this
Sacrilege or Theft? The opening for hair-splitting which such
an inquiry gives is, of course, a very wide one, and Hermogenes
simply revels in the indulgence thereof. But for us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>there is hardly a blade of pasture in the field on which centuries
of commentators browsed so greedily.</p>

<p class='c001'>Εὑρέσις again may be “for thoughts.” Again we can find
no single word for them, how much less for such niceties as <i>procatastasis</i>
and <i>prodiegesis</i>? The term covers the additions to the
case introduced by the speaker’s own invention, and ranges over
a vast variety of subtleties, ending with a treatment of some
Figures. The examination of “Ideas”<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c008'><sup>[139]</sup></a> shifts to the qualities
of the speech or speaker—clearness, purity, dignity, energy,
brilliancy, and very many others, ending with that survey of
great speakers and writers which has been noted. And finally
the treatise on “Cleverness of method” contains, not only more
figures, but a profusion of mostly brief and rather desultory
cautions. Throughout the book the author seems in a sort of
paroxysm of distinction and nomenclature: he is always striving
to make out some one thing to be at least two things, and
to fit each of the two with some technological form.</p>

<p class='c001'>We turn, naturally enough, to the dealings with great writers
mentioned above to see what this method, of analysis pushed to
the verge of mania, will give us. They are very short—not in
all filling twenty pages—and, as we might have expected,
they contain little more than simple reference to the technicalities
on which so much time has been spent. Literary
criticism, in short, becomes a form of chemical analysis. We
all know how this runs, as posted up, say, outside the walls of
a pump-room. The water contains iron so many grains, sulphur
so much, chlorine so much, nitrates a trace, and so forth. So
here. Lysias has moderate ἐπιμέλια, only a trace of γοργότης,
a certain amount of περιβολή κατ’ ἔννοιαν, but hardly any of
it κατὰ μέθοδον, very little that is axiomatic, but a great deal
of cleverness of method. On the other hand, Isæus has a great
deal of γοργότης,<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c008'><sup>[140]</sup></a> more abundant ἐπιμέλεια, and so with other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>things. He is not so good as Demosthenes (who, be it
observed, is Hermogenes' ideal), but much better than Lysias,
though he has not so much clearness of method, yet still a good
deal. Of the historians, Xenophon is very particularly ἀφελὴς
and also “sweet,” &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the following sentence may serve as well as any
other as an example of the method of Hermogenes. It is from
the fourth chapter of the third book, περὶ εὑρέσεων:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since many have set out many things about epicheiremes<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c008'><sup>[141]</sup></a>
and have spent much speech on this, and nobody has been able
to bring it home to the mind clearly, I shall endeavour, as
clearly as I can, to decide what is the invention of the
epicheireme which constructs the <i>kephalaion</i> or the <i>lusis</i>, and
what the invention of the <i>ergasia</i> which constructs the <i>epicheireme</i>,
and what the invention of the enthymeme which constructs
the <i>ergasia</i>.” I quote this with none of that ignorant
scorn of terminology, as such, which authorities so different as
Hamilton and Mill have justly denounced in reference to the
common eighteenth-century judgments of the schoolmen. But it
will be obvious to anybody that this kind of writing tends to
the construction of a sort of spider’s web of words, the symmetry
and exactness of construction whereof are in inverse ratio to
substance and practical use. It may catch flies; it undoubtedly
gives a sense of ingenuity and mastery to the spider. But it
has extremely little sweetness: it rather obstructs the light:
and it is not capable of being put (for it will not even staunch
wounds) to any of those practical purposes which objects possessing
very little sweetness, and no light at all, not unfrequently
subserve.</p>

<p class='c001'>We shall still have something to say of Hermogenes when
we come to the conclusion of this Rhetorical matter; but for the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Other “Arts,” &amp;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
present it is necessary to pass on to the writers
associated with him in this third volume of Walz.
The <cite>Art of Rhetoric</cite> of Rufus, whose age and identity are quite
unknown, is a very brief and rather slight skeleton, with
classifications, definitions of terms, and a few examples. Perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the most interesting thing about it is the addition of
a fourth kind—historic—to the usual three—forensic, and
symbouleutic, and epideictic. The very common habit, to
which reference has been already made, of taking examples
almost indiscriminately from orators and historians, has
evidently a logical connection (whether of cause or effect) with
this. An anonymous “Synopsis” is busied with Hermogenes
only. Joseph the Rhacendyte, who seems to have been a
thirteenth-century man and a native of the “little isle” of
Ithaca, is much fuller, has written an argument of his book in
about 150 iambic trimeters, of a kind which would bring severe
tribulation on the British schoolboy, and is noteworthy (though
he would be more so if it were not for his late day) because he
has evidently reached the stage where Rhetoric is recognised as
the Art of Literature. His chapter-headings have the curious
confusion and jumble which characterises much, if not most,
Rhetoric since the strict oratorical side was lost sight of,—he
has one on epistolary writing, one even on verse: and from
several points of view his interest is not infinitesimal. It is
very far from superfluous to note, though it may be impossible
to discuss in detail, the significance of the fact that while
another Anonym gives us four parts of a perfect speech—proem,
<i>diegesis</i>, <i>agon</i>, and epilogue, a third notes <em>eight</em> parts of
rhetorical speech—conception, style, figure, method, clause,
composition, punctuation, and rhythm.</p>

<p class='c001'>For, arbitrary and “cross,” in the technical sense, as these
divisions are (and as, it may be noted in passing, are all subsequent
attempts to produce things of the same kind), they testify
to a salutary sense of dissatisfaction. They make tacit or more
than tacit acknowledgment that something must be put in the
place of the old, defunct, purely oratorical Rhetoric—nay, that
that Rhetoric itself was incomplete, and would have needed
extension even if it had not been defunct of its old office. Of
still further Anonyms one (only partly given in Walz) is
interesting because it attempts a kind of historical introduction;
another is couched in “political” (accent-scanned)
verses, with curious refrains in the different sections, and with
odd prose insertions, as are the acknowledged epitomes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Tzetzes and Psellus. The remainder of the volume consists
of a brief dictionary of figures, a treatise of some interest
on “Rhetorical Metres” by a certain Castor, and a brief <i>ecthesis</i>
or exposition of rhetoric generally.</p>

<p class='c001'>The enormous collection of the scholia on Hermogenes
fortunately requires no detailed notice.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c008'><sup>[142]</sup></a> At most could we
pick out a few isolated passages bearing more or less directly
on our subject, and even these would be of scarcely any value,
seeing that the authorship and date of most of them are quite
unknown, and that hardly any can be said to possess that
intrinsic literary interest which might make questions of date
and authorship unimportant.</p>

<p class='c001'>The eighth and ninth volumes (really the ninth and tenth)
present matter of more individual interest—the eighth because
of the principal subject, which with comparatively little alteration
is treated by a great number of authors, the ninth for other
reasons. This subject—a subject which was to exercise a disastrous
attraction on the Rhetoric of the Renaissance and even
of later times—consists of the famous, or infamous, Figures.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c008'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>We know from a contemptuous phrase of Quintilian (see
<i>post</i>) that long before his time the facility of compounds in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Treatises on Figures.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Greek had induced the Greeks to multiply Figures
beyond all sense and endurance. Yet as we have
partly seen, in the so numerously attended school of Hermogenes,
these famous playthings, though not exactly neglected,
did not receive the first attention. Others, however, made
up for any apparent neglect of them. We have, specially
devoted to the subject, under the head of σχήματα or of
τρόποι, some fifteen or sixteen treatises—some by named
authors, others anonymous. The first, by a certain Alexander,
divides Figures as usual into those of the meaning and those
of the style, and enumerates twenty of the former and twenty-seven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>of the latter; Phœbammon deals more shortly with a
somewhat smaller number of figures, brought under more
general heads; and Tiberius the rhetorician confines himself
to the figures in Demosthenes. Herodian has a very large
number of <em>poetical</em> examples—a device which, as we shall see,
served to keep Rhetoric nearer and nearer to literature as time
went on. The little treatise of Polybius of Sardis deals less
with figures individually than with figurativeness; while an
Anonymus, neglecting to some extent the usual phraseology,
but reducing the usual procedure unawares to the absurd,
manages to give a vast number by taking individual expressions
from Homer and making a figure out of each. Zonæus follows
more succinctly on the lines of Alexander; another Anonymus
busies himself with Synecdoche only, and yet another adopts
the dictionary arrangement, as do divers others with Tropes.
One of the best pieces of the whole is the treatise of
Georgius Choeroboscus, a writer of the fourth or fifth century.
It is short, and deals with only a few figures; but
these are the important ones, the definitions are mostly clear
and sensible, and the examples, though not numerous, are
well chosen.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ninth volume opens with the not unimportant work
to which reference has been made above, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Interpretatione</cite></span>
<span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Demetrian</i> De Interpretatione.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of Demetrius the Uncertain. But it also contains
six other works on various divisions of Rhetoric,
one of which is at least interesting for the great
name of Longinus attached to it (as some would
have it with greater certainty than in the case of the work
that we would rather wish his), and others for other matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Demetrius takes a somewhat independent view of his subject,
which he puts on a level with Poetics, but does not call
Rhetoric. As Poetry, he states, deals with—or at least is
distinguished and divided by—metres (this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>netteté</i></span> is refreshing,
and we shall go farther to fare very often worse),
so what are called clauses<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c008'><sup>[144]</sup></a> divide and distinguish the interpretation
of prose speech. Then, directing attention directly
to clauses, he illustrates their kinds from the respective beginnings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>of the histories of Hecatæus and the <cite>Anabasis</cite> of
Xenophon, and prefers (though not to the exclusion of what
he does <em>not</em> prefer) short clauses to long. From clauses he
goes to periods, discussing and analysing their composition
rather narrowly, and then returns to parallel clauses, whence
striking off to <i>hom&oelig;oteleuta</i> he continues his treatise under
a great number of similar heads, betraying the slightly heterogeneous
and higgledy-piggledy arrangement which, as we have
said already, is so apt to beset these writers on Rhetoric. But
he maintains throughout a creditable desire to identify his subject
with the Art of Prose Composition, and not merely with
Persuasion, or with the composition of an extremely artificial
kind of prize essay on lines more artificial still.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rhetor Menander, who has left us a treatise on the
third division of rhetorical speeches, Epideictic (generally subdivided
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Menander on Epideictic.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
into encomia and invectives), is thought to
have lived at the end of the third century. From
the first his treatment is of considerable literary interest,
because he handles the sources of the material of these curiously
artificial compositions. First, he takes the hymns about
the gods, and here, according to the way of his class, he
rushes at once into a classification. There are, it seems, nine
kinds of hymns—Cletic, apopemptic,<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c008'><sup>[145]</sup></a> physic, mythic, genealogical,
artificial, prayerful, deprecating, and mixed—the appearance
of which last heading, here and elsewhere, always makes
one wonder how a person of any logical gifts could write it
down without seeing that he made his whole classification
ridiculous if not fraudulent thereby. Then he quotes a great
number of authors, ranging them under the heads. A separate
chapter is next given to each kind, still referring to many
authors, but unluckily seldom or never citing the actual passages.
Next he passes to the Praising of Cities, that very
important part of the bread-study of the travelling rhetor,
who had to make himself welcome by accommodating his
lectures to local patriotism, as we see, for instance, in Dion
Chrysostom (<i>v. infra</i>). Hardly in the whole of this dully
fantastic division of literature shall we find anything quainter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>than the sections devoted to this subject. If the city is a
landward one, you will point out how safe it is from piratical
attacks; if it is on the coast, you will dwell on the splendours
and advantages of the sea. “How to praise Harbours,” “How
to praise Gulfs,” “What is the best fashion of encomium for
an Acropolis?”—these actual headings meet us. At even fuller
length the orator is told how to praise not merely the site
but the population and its origin, the neighbours (perhaps
dispraising them might come in best here), the customs, and
so forth. In short, the little treatise reminds one most of
those modern cookery-books which—assuming the housewives
who will read them to be of Paraguayan kin, and to continue
idiots—give not only prescriptions for dishes but lists of dinners
and rules of etiquette. One hardly wonders that a man like
Lucian, of mother-wit compact to the finger-tips, should have
soon left a profession in which the average practitioner seems
to have been taken for granted as next door to a fool, without
either common-sense or imagination enough to meet the most
obvious requirements of his business.</p>

<p class='c001'>One  MS. of Menander stops here, but another gives us
much more of the same kind, dealing with the βασιλικὸς
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Others.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
λόγος—flattery of kings—with epithalamia, with
consolations, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>et cetera</i></span>. The general scheme is
much the same, and at least does not disincline us to believe
it from the same hand. The short treatise of Alexander on
Rhetorical Starting-points is very technical and not very
profitable; but it falls in with the Menandrine books in showing
how this business of flattery—the reducing to system of
the “dodges” of the auctioneer or the advertising agent—was,
latterly at least, the mainstay of the rhetorician. The
two books of Aristides' <cite>Art of Rhetoric</cite>, on the other hand,
busy themselves not with the epideictic but with the political
speech, and deal chiefly with its technical qualities, our old
friends. Apsines deals with the exordium only, and Minucianus
with the epicheireme or imperfect rhetorical argument.
Between them comes the treatise attributed to Longinus by
some, and for that reason, if for no other, worth a little fuller
examination.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“That<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c008'><sup>[146]</sup></a>, so to speak, there is nothing better in man’s possession
than memory, who in his senses will deny? Some indeed
praise Oblivion, as Euripides—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘O blessed forgetfulness of woes,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>as he calls it. But I should say that Lethe and the outgoing
of memory help us little or nothing, hurt the best and greatest
things of life, defraud and keep us short of happiness.
For the most hateful of sins and crimes, ingratitude, we find
oft occurring when memory’s powers fail; but he who remembers
benefits is neither ungrateful nor unjust. When men
forget the laws and the doctrines that keep us straight, needs
must they become poor creatures, and bad, and shameless.
Yea, all folly and all inculture of soul occur through forgetfulness.
But he who remembers best is chiefly wise.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This may not itself be the very crown of wisdom; it is not
Plato; it is not even <cite>Ecclesiasticus</cite>. But it is at any rate the
work of a man who can look a little beyond <i>stasis</i> and <i>diegema</i>.
As if we were to have nothing certain from this great critic,
the attribution of this treatise also to him is only based on a
conjecture of Ruhnken’s, itself depending on a citation by the
commentator John of Sicily in the thirteenth century. It is
devoted to the subject of Εὔρεσις—so badly translated by
“Invention”—and it treats of its subject under the heads of
<i>prosopopœia</i>, starting-points, elocutory mimicry, memory, topics
<span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Rhetoric
<i>or</i> De Inventione <i>of Longinus</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
drawn from things connected with the chief good,
and passion. There is a fairly wide range of literary
reference, though few citations are given at length.
And it is only fair to bear in mind that even in the
Περὶ Ὕψους, short and broken as it is, there are signs of a
certain weakness for Figures and other technicalities, indications
that in his more professional moments, and when inspiration
deserted him, even the author of that wonderful little
masterpiece might have approached (though he never could
long have been satisfied with) the endless, the fruitless, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>exasperating <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>distinguo</i></span> which seemed to be art, and wisdom,
and taste, to Hermogenes and the rest. And though one
cannot quite agree with Walz that there is in this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Inventione</cite></span>
a “doctrine drawn from Homer and the poets, elegantly and
equably disposed,” yet one must admit that the handling shows
something different from, and above, the heartbreaking jargon-mongering
of the usual rhetorician. What follows is not the
style of the Longinus that we know; it seems to come short of
his manly sense almost as much as of his far-reaching flights
of poetical appreciation. But it is a long way from the mere
arrangement of compartments and ticket-boxes, and the mere
indulgence in a kind of game of rhetorical “egg-hat” in and
out of them when they are made.</p>

<p class='c001'>Enough, perhaps, has been said of the defects of this great
mass of composition, both from the point of view of our special
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Survey of School Rhetoric.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
investigation and from more general ones. It remains
to say something of its merits from the
former. As will have been seen, the relations of
the rhetoricians to literary criticism differ at first sight surprisingly—less
so, perhaps, when they come to be examined.
Sometimes the general literary view seems to be almost entirely
lost in a wilderness of details and technicalities. But
sometimes also the merely forensic tendency disappears, the
merely technical one in the narrow sense effaces itself, and we
have an almost pure treatise on Composition, limited it may be
by arbitrary restrictions, conditioned by professional needs, but
still Composition in general—that is to say, after a fashion, and
in a manner, Literature. Every now and then, as we saw
above, the writer rises to the conception of Rhetoric as Prosaics—as
the other half of that Art of Literature of which Poetics
is the one. And—a less good thing, but also not without
its good side—we even find glimpses and glimmerings of the
notion, to be taken up and widely developed later, of Rhetoric
as <em>including</em> Poetics.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the best and most important part of the matter has yet
to be summarised. The technical study of Rhetoric, even when
pushed to the extremities of the terminological and classifying
mania, encouraged and almost necessitated constant overhauling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of actual literature for examples, and encouraged the characterisation
of famous authors from this point of view. Even the
orators by themselves formed no inconsiderable or undistinguished
<i>corpus</i> of Greek prose literature. But, as we have seen,
it was customary, even for very strict formalists, to include the
historians whose connection with the orators was so close;
and it was very difficult to exclude philosophical writers,
especially Plato. A man must have been of preternatural
stolidity if he could ransack Demosthenes and Isæus, Herodotus
and Thucydides and Xenophon, Plato, and the school
philosophers whom we have so freely lost, and if he did not
in the process develop some notion of prose literary criticism
at large, nay, formulate some rules of it. And, as we have also
seen from the very first, poetry was by no means barred. The
orator might very often quote it; he was constantly to go to
it for suggestions of subject or treatment, beauties of style,
examples of figure and form. Therefore, directly if not indirectly,
the rhetorical teacher and the historical student accepted
the whole of literature for their province.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the actual <em>results</em> of this enormous period, the best part
(even if we cut off the Dark Ages) of a thousand years of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Practical Rhetoricians or Masters of Epideictic.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
elaborate concentration upon an extremely artificial
art, our remains are in proportion much less than
we should expect; in fact, it is hardly too much
to say that they are less than those of the technical
books which taught how to produce them. It is
scarcely fair to call Dionysius of Halicarnassus a rhetorician,
though he sometimes goes near to being one. He is a serious
teacher of Rhetoric, not a giver of displays in it, a real literary
critic, a laborious historian. Plutarch is saved from inclusion
in the class by the very same characteristic which interferes
so sadly with his literary criticism as such. He is too practical,
too keenly interested in life, too busy about the positive
sciences of ethical and physical inquiry, to devote himself to
rhetorical exercises of the pure declamatory kind. That
Lucian did so devote himself for no inconsiderable time, we
know from his own description of his breaking away from the
Delilah Rhetoric; and there are scraps of purely or mainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>rhetorical matter in him even as it is. But though it be perfectly
possible to serve two mistresses, no man ever could have,
for his Queens of Brentford, Irony and the falser and more artificial
kind of Rhetoric. The two are irreconcilable enemies:
they would make their lover’s life an impossible and maddening
inconsistency. We must therefore look elsewhere, and in
writers on the whole lesser, for the artificial Rhetorical composition
which is of interest to us, not merely inasmuch as it
sometimes deals with or comes near to literary criticism itself,
but as it is, even on other occasions, a valuable and undeniable
evidence as to the state of universal <em>crisis</em>, the condition of
literary taste, at its time. We shall find such witnesses in
Dion Chrysostom for the late first and early second century;
in Aristides of Smyrna and Maximus Tyrius for the second
exclusively; in Philostratus for the end of the second and
the beginning of the third; while to these we may perhaps
add Libanius and Themistius for the fourth, with the imperial
rhetorician Julian to keep them company.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of these, Dion Chrysostom is not merely the earliest in date,
but, on the whole, the most important to literature. He
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dion Chrysostom.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
appears to have been a distinguished and rather
fortunate example of a “gentleman of the press” (as
we should now say) before the press existed. He travelled <a id='corr109.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='over'>over a</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_109.24'><ins class='correction' title='over'>over a</ins></a></span>
great part of the Roman Empire in the pursuit of his profession
as Lecturer—that perhaps comes nearest to it—and would
appear to have been well rewarded. The description of his
morning’s employment, which begins his study of the three
Poets' plays on <cite>Philoctetes</cite>,<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c008'><sup>[147]</sup></a> is one of the most interesting
passages in the later and less-known classics, and so is worth
giving here, though it exists in at least one unlearned
language: “I rose about the first hour of the day, both because
I was poorly, and because the air was cooler at dawn, and more
like autumn, though it was midsummer. I made my toilette,
said my prayers, and then getting into my curricle, went
several times round the Hippodrome, driving as easily and
quietly as possible. Then I took a walk, rested shortly, bathed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>and anointed myself, and after eating a slight breakfast, took up
some tragedies.” The careful “study of the body,” the quiet
affluence of a well-to-do professional man, and the attention to
professional work without any hurry or discomfort, are all well
touched off here; and what follows gives us, as it happens, the
closest approach to our subject proper to be found in the considerable
collection of Dion’s Orations, or, as they have been
much more properly called, Essays. There are, however, others
which are more characteristic of this division of literature, and
we may deal with these first.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole conception of the kind of piece, of which Dion
himself has left us some fourscore examples, is a curious, and
to merely modern readers (nor perhaps to them only) something
of a puzzling one. It is called an Oration because it was
intended to be delivered by word of mouth; but it often, if not
usually, has no other oratorical characteristic. The terms
“lecture” and “essay” have also been applied to it incidentally
above, and both have some, while neither has
exact, application. Except that its subject is generally (not
always) profane, it has strong points of resemblance to some
kinds of Sermon. Classified by the subject, it presents at first
sight features which look distinct enough, though perhaps the
distinctness rather vanishes on examination. Not a few of the
examples (and probably those which were more immediately
profitable, though they could not be used so often) are what
may be called local panegyrics, addresses to the citizens of
Corinth, Tarsus, Borysthenes, New Ilium, in which their
historical and literary associations are ingeniously worked in,
and the importance of the community is more or less delicately
“cracked up.” Others are moral discourses on Vices and
Virtues, others abstract discussions on politics, others of yet
other sorts. But the point in which they all agree, the point
which is their real characteristic, is that they are all rather
displays of art, rather directly analogous to a musical “recital”
or an entertainment of feats of strength and skill, than directed
to any definite purpose of persuasion, or to the direct exposition of
any subject. The object is to show how neatly the speaker can
play the rhetorical game, how well he can do his theme. Each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>is, in fact (what Thucydides so detested the idea of his history
appearing to be), a distinct <i>agonisma</i>, a competitive display of
cleverness and technical accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing perhaps is more tedious than a game that is out of
fashion; and this game has been out of fashion for a very long
time. Moreover, it has been out of fashion so long, and its
vogue depended upon conditions now so entirely changed, that
it is for us occasionally difficult, even by strong effort of mental
projection into the past, to discover where the attraction can
ever have lain. Equally good style (and Dion’s is beyond
question good) could surely have been expended on something
less utterly arbitrary and unreal. Nor do these reflections
present themselves more strongly anywhere than in regard to
the pieces which touch more directly on our subject. Take, for
instance, the Trojan oration, which has for its second title
“That Troy was not captured.” It is supposed to be addressed
to the citizens of the New Ilium, and to clear away the
reproach of the Old. The means taken to do this are mainly
two. In the first place, the authority of an entirely unnamed
Egyptian priest, the author of a book named unintelligibly, is
invoked as giving the lie direct to Homer, and supporting himself
on the documentary evidence of <i>stelæ</i>, which (unluckily) had
perished. The second argument (obviously thought of most
weight) is an elaborate examination of the Homeric narrative
itself from the point of view of what seems probable, decent, and
so forth to Dion the Golden-mouthed. Some of the objections
are new; most of them very old. Is it likely that a lady who
had the honour of being the bedfellow of Zeus would be doubtful
of her beauty if an Idæan shepherd did not certify to it?
Would a goddess have given such improper rewards to Paris,
and put herself in such an ugly relation to Helen, who, by one
story, was her sister? What a shocking thing that the poet
should constantly speak well of Ulysses and yet represent him
as a liar! How could Homer have had any knowledge of the
language of the gods, or have seen through the cloud on Ida?
And so forth, for some sixty mortal pages.</p>

<p class='c001'>From such a procedure no literary criticism is to be expected;
and, as has been said, the difficulty is to discern what was its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>original attraction. As a serious composition it is clearly nowhere;
as a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>jeu d’esprit</i></span>, the rules of the game quite puzzle us,
and the spirit seems utterly to have evaporated. The Olympic<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c008'><sup>[148]</sup></a>
“On the Idea of God” has been cited by some as a contribution
to our subject, and certainly contains some remarks about Plato
and about Myths—interesting remarks too. In substance it is
a supposed discourse of Phidias to the assembled Greeks on the
principles he had in mind in the conception of his statue of
Zeus; but its most interesting passage is a comparison of
poetry and sculpture. The mixture of dialects in Homer is
compared to the making up of the palette and the use of
“values” in painting; the selection of archaic words to the
choice of the virtuoso lighting on an antique medal. The
variety of epithet and synonym for the description of natural
and other objects is contrasted with the restraint and simplicity
of the sculptor’s art. The passage is a really remarkable one,
and stands almost alone, in elaboration if not in suggestion,
as the forerunner of a kind of criticism, fruitful but rather
dangerous, which has often been supposed to have originated
with Winckelmann and Lessing and Diderot in the last century.
But it stands almost alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>The greater apparent promise of the paper on the synonymous
plays is less well fulfilled. Dion seems to imply that this
was the only instance where the Three competed on the very
same subject, and he finds in the three pieces agreeable
instances of the well-known general characteristics of their
authors—the grandeur, simplicity, and audacity of Æschylus;
the artifice, variety, rhetorical skill of Euripides; the mediocrity
(in no evil sense) and the charm of Sophocles. He has also
some interesting remarks on the chorus, together with some
others less interesting, because more in the common style of
ancient criticism, on impossibilities, improbabilities, breaches
of usage and unity, and the like. Dion, in fact, goes so far as
to express an indirect wish that the chorus were cut out
of tragedy. He had, no doubt, lost the sense of the religious
use which certainly existed in Æschylus, and perhaps survived
in Sophocles; he could not but observe the combination of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>nullity and superfluity (which may too often be detected even
in these great poets) of the chorus, if regarded as anything else
than an intercalated lyric of the most exquisite beauty; and he
of course saw that the choruses of Euripides were often as
merely <i>parabasic</i>, as entirely separated from all strict dramatic
connection, as any address to the audience in Aristophanes
himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, it may best be said of the Golden-mouthed that,
in other circumstances, and if he had cared, he might have made
a critic perhaps better than Dionysius, and perhaps not so very
far below Longinus; but that, as a matter of fact, neither time,
circumstances, nor personal disposition attracted him, save here
and there, to the subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is another author, not far removed in age from Dion
Chrysostom, whom I should be sorry to pass without at least
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Aristides of Smyrna.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as minute an examination. Had we only the notices
of him which exist, with a few fragments, there is
perhaps no Greek writer from whom it would be reasonable
to expect an abundance of literary criticism, of a type almost
as startlingly modern as that of Longinus himself, with more
confidence than that with which we might expect it from
Aristides of Smyrna.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c008'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Longinus has been blamed by M. Egger<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c008'><sup>[150]</sup></a> for comparing<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c008'><sup>[151]</sup></a>
this rhetorician with Demosthenes. But the excellent historian
of Greek criticism must have forgotten the epigram, quoted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>elsewhere,<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c008'><sup>[152]</sup></a> in which Aristides is frankly ranked, not merely
with Demosthenes but with Thucydides, as a writer, as well
as the other testimonies, both of antiquity and of the Renaissance,
which are conveniently collected in an article of
Jebb’s edition, to be found in that of Dindorf.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c008'><sup>[153]</sup></a> It is true
that Dindorf himself speaks contemptuously of his client, but
Dindorf was too deeply sworn a servant of strictly classical
Greek to tolerate the pretensions of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>précieux</i></span> of the Antonine
age. As a matter of fact, not only is Aristides a good,
though by no means easy,<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c008'><sup>[154]</sup></a> writer of Greek, but both the
qualities and the defects of his writing and the causes of his
difficulty are such as ought to have disposed him to literary
criticism in the best sense. This hardness does not arise from
irregular syntax, nor from any of the commoner causes of
“obscurity.” What makes it necessary to read him with no
common care and attention is, in the first place, the cobweb-like
subtlety, not to say tenuity and intricacy, of his thought; and,
in the second, his use of not ostensibly strange or archaic
language with the most elusive <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>nuances</i></span> of difference from its
common employment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now these are characteristics which are by no means uncommonly
found in persons and in times friendly to criticism.
And the love of Aristides for literature (at least for the
rhetorical side of it) is not only outspoken, but to all
appearance unfeigned. His devotion is not merely valetudinarian,
but voluntary. If there is a rhetorical extravagance
in the phrase, there is a more than rhetorical sincerity
in the sentiment of his declarations that, while others may
find love or bathing or drinking or hunting sweet, speeches<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c008'><sup>[155]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>are his sole delight: they absorb all his friendship and all
his faculties; they are to him as parents and children, as
business and pastime. It is about them that he invokes
Aphrodite: he plays with them and works with them, rejoices
in them, embraces them, knocks only at their doors. Elsewhere,
“the whole gain and sum of life to man is oratorical
occupation”; and elsewhere again, “I would rather have the
gift of speech, with a modest and honourable life as man best
may, than be Darius the son of Hystaspes two thousand times
over: and everything seems to me little in comparison with
this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This is something like a “declaration.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor, on merely running down the list of the fairly voluminous
extant works of Aristides (especially when the inner meanings,
which do not always appear in the titles, are grasped), do matters
look unpromising. The majority of the pieces are indeed pure
epideictic—discourses to or about the gods, a mighty “Panathenaic”
(the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i></span>, with only one rival, of the author)—panegyrics
of Smyrna, Rome, and other places, “Leuctrics” (<i>i.e.</i>,
debating-society speeches, on the side of the Lacedæmonians,
on the side of the Thebans, and neutral), arguments for and
against sending assistance to the Athenian expedition at
Syracuse, all the stock—a stock surprise to us—of this curious
declamation-commonplace. But there are four pieces (between
them making up the stuff of a good-sized volume) in
which, from such a man, literary criticism might seem to be
inevitable. They are the περὶ τοῦ μὴ δεῖν κωμῳδεῖν<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c008'><sup>[156]</sup></a> (a discourse
whether comedy shall be permitted or not), the long
Defence of Rhetoric (περὶ ῥητορικῆς)<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c008'><sup>[157]</sup></a> against Plato’s attacks,
especially in the <cite>Gorgias</cite>, the very much longer and oddly
named ὑπὲρ τῶν τεττάρων,<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c008'><sup>[158]</sup></a> an apology for Miltiades, Themistocles,
Pericles, and Cimon, which completes this, and the
still more oddly named περὶ τοῦ παραφθέγματος<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c008'><sup>[159]</sup></a> (“Concerning
my blunder”), which meets, with not a little tartness and
wounded conceit, but with a great deal of ingenuity, the suggestion,
through a third person, of some “d——d good-natured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>friend,”<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c008'><sup>[160]</sup></a> that Aristides had committed a fault of taste by
insinuating praises of himself in an address to the divinity.
We turn to these, and we find as nearly as possible nothing
critical. Glimmers of interest appear, as in the description of
historians (ii. 513), as “those between poetry and rhetoric,” but
they are extinguished almost at once. It would be quite
impossible to treat the comedy question from a less literary
standpoint than that of Aristides; we might have Plutarch
speaking, except that the writing is more “precious” and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>point-de-vice</i></span>.
The “Apology for my blunder” consists mainly in a
string, by no means lacking in ingenuity, of citations from poets,
orators, and others, in which they indulge, either for themselves
or their personages, in strains somewhat self-laudatory. As for
the more than four hundred pages of “On Rhetoric” and “For
the Four,” they also avoid the literary handling, the strictly
critical grip of the subject, with a persistency which, as has
been observed in other cases, is simply a mystery, unless we
suppose that the writer was either laboriously shunning this, or
quite unconscious of its possibility and promise. Pages after
pages on the old <i>aporia</i> whether Rhetoric is an art or not,
sheets after sheets on the welldoing of the Four, on Plato’s
evil-speaking, we have. But, unless I have missed it, never a
passage on the magnificent literature with which Rhetoric has
enriched Greece, on the more magnificent rhetoric which the
accuser of the brethren has himself displayed in accusing her.
To a man of the subtlety of Aristides, of his enthusiasm for
literature, of his <em>flair</em> for a popular and striking paradox, one
would imagine that this beating up of the enemy’s quarters
would be irresistibly tempting. But it is certainly not in his
main attack: and though, in the vast stretch of wiredrawn
argument and precious expression, one may have missed something,
I do not think that it is even in the reserves or the
parentheses.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are perhaps few, at least among the less read Greek
writers, who, in small compass and at no great expense of
trouble, throw more negative light on Greek criticism than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Maximus Tyrius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Maximus Tyrius.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c008'><sup>[161]</sup></a> This rhetorician or philosopher (he would
probably have disclaimed the first epithet and modestly
demanded promotion to the second) has left us,
in a style as easy as that of Aristides is difficult, and showing
at least a strong velleity to be Platonic, some forty essays, or
dissertations, or theses. They are on questions or propositions
of the usual kind, as these: “Pleasure may be a good but is not
a stable thing.” “On Socratic Love” (an amiable but slightly
ludicrous example of whitewashing everybody, from Socrates
himself to Sappho). “On the God of Socrates and Plato,” &amp;c.,
&amp;c. Several of them might, at any rate from the titles, seem
to touch our subject; two at least might seem to be obliged to
touch it. These are the Tenth (in Reiske’s order), “Whether
the poets or the philosophers have given the soundest ideas of
the gods?” and the Twenty-third, “Whether Plato was right
in banishing Homer from his Republic?” Yet, apt to slip
between our fingers as we have found and shall find apparently
critical theses of this sort, hardly one (at least outside Plutarch)
is so utterly eel-like as those of Maximus of Tyre. As to the
first,<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c008'><sup>[162]</sup></a> he suggests that the very question is a misunderstanding—as
no doubt it is, though not quite in his sense.
Philosophy and poetry are really the same thing. Poetry is a
philosophy, “senior in time, metrical in harmony, based on
fiction as to its arguments.” Philosophy is a poetry “renewed
in youth, more lightly equipped in harmony, more certain
in sense.” They are, in short, as like as my fingers to my
fingers, “and there are ænigmas in both.” If you are wise you
will interpret the poets allegorically, but go to the philosophers
for clear statements. And we must allow, to the credit of the
former, that there is no poet who talks such mischievous nonsense
as Epicurus.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is all that, as a critic, Maximus has to say on this head;
and though at least equally ingenious in evasion, he gives us
nothing more solid in the debate on Homer and Plato.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c008'><sup>[163]</sup></a> He
speaks, indeed, words of sense (by no means always kept in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>mind by critics) as to the absolute compatibility of admiration
of Homer with admiration of Plato. But his argument for
this, and at the same time the whole argument of the essay,
is only a kind of “fetch.” Homer was banished from the
Platonic Republic not because Plato thought him bad <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>,
but because the special conditions of the Republic itself made
Homer an inconvenient inmate. He was not qualified for
admission to this particular club: that was all. Equally far
from our orbit is a third essay, the Thirty-second,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c008'><sup>[164]</sup></a> the subject
of which is, “Is there any definite philosophic opinion<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c008'><sup>[165]</sup></a> in
Homer?” Elsewhere Maximus has refused to include literary
criticism where it might justly have been expected: here (with,
it must be admitted, much countenance from persons in more
recent times, and especially in the present day) he determines
to import into literary criticism things which have no business
there. He begins, indeed, with a hearty and not unhappy
eulogy of Homer himself for his range of subject and knowledge:
but the rest of the piece is little more than an application
of the theory laid down earlier, that philosophers and poets
are only the same people in different coats, of antique or modern
cut as the case may be, dancing to different tunes, and gesticulating
in a different way. It may be so; but whether
it is or not, Maximus has nothing more to tell us in our
own division.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c008'><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There are not many positions in literary history more apparently
covetable than that of being the first certain authority
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Philostratus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for a definition of Imagination which (in a sense
different from Sir Thomas Browne’s) “antiquates
antiquity,” which anticipates Shakespeare, which has been
piously but vainly thought to have been first reached in
criticism by Addison, and which, in its fulness, and as critically
put, waited for the Germans of the late eighteenth century, if
not for their greater scholar Coleridge, to display it in perfection.
When it is added that this person was a professional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>rhetorician, that he had sufficient original, or at least mimetic,
skill to supply the pattern of</p>

      <div class='line'>“Drink to me only with thine eyes,”</div>

<p class='c019'>and of others of the prettiest if not the greatest things in
literature, with sufficient appreciation of arts other than literature
to have left us a capital collection of descriptions of
painting,—it may seem that great, or at least interesting,
literary criticism must have proceeded from him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet whoso shall go to the work of Flavius Philostratus<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c008'><sup>[167]</sup></a> in
search of this will be wofully disappointed, unless (and perhaps
even if) he have the wisdom necessary to the acceptance
of what the gods provide, and the more or less resigned relinquishment
of what they do not.</p>

<p class='c001'>Philostratus is in fact a writer of considerable charm. The
<cite>Life of Apollonius</cite> is readable, not only for its matter and its
literary associations with Keats through Burton; and the
smaller <cite>Lives of the Sophists</cite> are not unimportant for literary
history. The <cite>Eikones</cite> are perhaps the best descriptions of
pictures before Diderot,<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c008'><sup>[168]</sup></a> and the <cite>Letters</cite> are really nectareous.
Gifford, when deservedly trouncing Cumberland (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>alias</i></span> Sir
Fretful Plagiary) for finding fault with Jonson because he
made up the exquisite poem above cited from Philostratus,
would have done better to vindicate the original as well from
Cumberland’s bad taste and ignorance. “Despicable sophist,”
“obscure collection of love-letters,” “parcel of unnatural, far-fetched
conceits,” “calculated to disgust a man of Jonson’s
classical taste,” are expressions which, as Gifford broadly
hints, probably express not so much Cumberland’s own taste
as that of his grandfather Bentley, who, if one of the greatest
of scholars, was sometimes, if not always, one of the worst
of literary critics. But Gifford, who, with all his acuteness,
wit, and polemic power, represented too much the dregs of
the neo-classic school on points of taste, was probably of no
very different opinion. The fact is that, not merely in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>passages which Ben has adapted, sometimes literally, for this
marvellous cento, but in many others, the very wine, the very
roses, of the luscious and florid school of poetical sentiment are
given by Philostratus himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if they are his own, and not, as seems more likely, prose
paraphrases of lost poems by some other, he was not one of the
“poets who contain a critic.” Not only does he put the remarkable
definition<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c008'><sup>[169]</sup></a> of φαντασία, which it is not clear that
even Longinus fully grasped, in the mouth of Apollonius; but
it is very noticeable that Apollonius is there speaking <em>not</em> of
literary art, but of sculpture and painting. In the description
of paintings themselves there is no criticism. And perhaps
among the numerous examples which we have of the strange
difference of view between the ancients and at least some of
ourselves on the suggestiveness of literature, there is no passage
more striking than the <cite>Heroic Dialogue</cite><a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c008'><sup>[170]</sup></a> on the subject of
Homer between a Phœnician stranger and a vine-dresser at
Eleus in the Thracian Chersonese, where Protesilaus was supposed
to be buried. The stuff of this fantastic piece is the information,
about the matters of the Trojan war, supposed to be
supplied to the vine-dresser by Protesilaus himself. There is
one passage of literary estimate of the ordinary kind, but the
whole is one of those curious corrections of Homeric statement
which served as the ancestors of the new and anti-Homeric
“tale of Troy” in the Middle Ages, and which are among the
numerous puzzles of ancient literature to us, until we have
mastered the strange antique horror of fiction as fiction. We
cannot conceive any one—after childhood—otherwise than
humorously attempting to make out that Sir Walter Scott did
injustice to Waverley, and that in the duel with Balmawhapple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the Baron was only second, not principal, insinuating that the
novelist has concealed the real secret of Flora’s indifference to
her lover, which was that she was determined, like Beatrix
Esmond, to be the Chevalier’s mistress, or declaring that Fergus,
instead of being captured and executed, died gloriously in a
skirmish omitted by historians, after putting the English to
flight. But this is what the ancients were always doing with
Homer; and it is scarcely too much to say that until this
attitude of mind is entirely discarded, literary criticism in the
proper sense is impossible.</p>

<p class='c001'>The relatively considerable space, some six or seven pages,
which is allotted to Libanius in Egger’s book, may have encouraged
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Libanius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
readers to expect some considerable contribution
to critical literature from that sophist and
rhetorician. But a careful reading of the French historian’s
text will show that he has really nothing to produce to justify
the space assigned: and an independent examination of
Libanius himself (which, as hinted already, is not too easy to
make<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c008'><sup>[171]</sup></a>) will more than confirm this uncomfortable suspicion.
Libanius is enormously copious, and he is not exactly contemptible,<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c008'><sup>[172]</sup></a>
seeing that he can apply the sort of “Wardour
Street” Attic, in which he and the better class of his contemporaries
wrote, to a large number of subjects with a great deal
of skill. But the curse of artificiality is over everything that
he writes:<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c008'><sup>[173]</sup></a> and, to do him justice, his writings proclaim the fact
beforehand with the most praiseworthy frankness. They belong
almost entirely to those classes of conventional exercise of which
full account has been given, and will be given, in the present
Book and its successor. They are <cite>Progymnasmata</cite>, <cite>Meletæ</cite>, “orations,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>that is to say, rather more practical compositions of the
same class, ethical dissertations, letters of the kind in which A
writes that B is a new Demosthenes, and B replies that A
really is a second Plato. The Progymnasmata include all the
kinds mentioned earlier in this chapter, fables and narrations,
uses and sentences, encomia and ethopoiæ and the rest; the
Meletæ range from the complaint of a parasite who has been
done out of his dinner, through all manner of historical, mythical,
and fantastic cases, to the question whether Lais (after
being exiled) had not better be recalled as a useful member of
society. But literary criticism is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nullibi</i></span>. If it were anywhere
we should look for it in the comparison of Demosthenes and
Æschines which figures among the <cite>Progymnasmata</cite>, in the <cite>Life</cite><a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c008'><sup>[174]</sup></a>
of the first-named orator and the arguments to his speeches, and
perhaps in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Apologia Socratis</cite></span>. In the first there is not a
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>scintilla</i></span> of the kind: the comparison wholly concerns the lives,
characters, and successes of the two. In the <cite>Apologia</cite> there is
pretty constant reference to Socrates' conversation, with some to
that of others, Prodicus, Protagoras, &amp;c. But any literary consideration
is avoided with that curious superciliousness, or more
curious subterfuge, which we have noticed often already, and
which is so rigid and so complete that it suggests malice prepense—a
deliberate and perverse abstention. The “editorial”
matter (to vary a happy phrase of M. Egger) on Demosthenes
is even more surprisingly barren,—mere biography, and mere
reference to the stock technicalities and classifications of <i>stasis</i>
and the like, practically exhaust it. I do not know how far the
fact that he composed, in answer to Aristides,<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c008'><sup>[175]</sup></a> a defence of stage
dancing or pantomime, may by some be reckoned to him as literary
righteousness. In his wordy <cite>Autobiography</cite><a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c008'><sup>[176]</sup></a> I can find
nothing to our purpose: and though, in the difficulties of study
of him referred to, I daresay I have not thoroughly sifted the
huge haystack of the <cite>Orations</cite>, I think there is very little more
there. The <cite>For Aristophanes</cite><a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c008'><sup>[177]</sup></a> has nothing to do with the Aristophanes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>we know or with literature, except that it seems to have
been the speech in which Julian (<i>v. infra</i>, p. <a href='#Page_126'>126</a>) discovered
such wonderful qualities.</p>

<p class='c001'>The “Monody” and the “Funeral Oration” on Julian himself
may again excite expectation, for the dead Emperor was certainly
a man of letters; but they will equally disappoint it.
The quaintly named “To Those Who Do Not Speak” (pupils of
his who on growing up and entering the senate or other public
bodies prove dumb dogs) might help us, but does not. Libanius
merely exhorts these sluggards, in the most general way, to
be good boys, to pay less attention to chariot-racing and
more to books. By far the larger number of the “Orations”
are on political or legal subjects, and it would be unreasonable
to expect critical edification from them; but even where it
might seem likely to come in, it does not. The “Against
Lucian” (Reiske, vol. iii.) is in the same case as the “For
Aristophanes.” The not uninteresting oration in defence of the
system of his School (No. LXV., the last of Reiske’s third volume)
constantly refers to a matter which might be of great concern to
us—the difficulty which schoolmasters or professors had at this
time in keeping their pupils up to the mark in the <em>two</em> languages
and literatures, Greek and Latin. But the discourse is
not turned our way.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor do the <cite>Letters</cite>, our last resort, furnish us with much consolation.
Their enormous number—there are over 1600 in
Wolf’s edition of the Greek originals, while the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>editio princeps</i></span> of
Zambicarius, in Latin only, adds problems of divagation and
duplication to the heart’s content of a certain order of scholar—is
to some extent mitigated by their usual brevity. But this
very brevity is often an aggravation not a mitigation of teen.
Very many are mere “notes,” as we should say, written, indeed,
with the pomp and circumstance of the epistoler-rhetorician,
but about nothing or next to nothing. Very often Libanius
seems to be unconsciously anticipating the young person who
said that he did not <em>read</em> books, he wrote them. Sometimes,
at least, an apparently promising reference leads to a bitter
disappointment, as in the case of that to Longinus. The reader—his
appetite only whetted by the exertion of rectifying a
miscitation in Wolf’s <cite>Preface</cite> (it quotes the Letter as 990, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>it is really 998)—at last approaches his quest, and reads as
follows: <cite>To Eusebius</cite>, “The speech [or book] which I want is
<cite>Odenathus</cite>, and it is by Longinus. You must give it me, and
keep your promise.” This is indeed precious; though a remembrance
of the information, epistolary and other, vouchsafed in
many modern biographies, may moderate sarcastic impulses.
No sarcasm, but profound sympathy, should be excited by the
professor’s constant complaints of headache; yet again they
are unilluminative for our purpose. In fact, such examination
as I have been able to give to these Epistles shows that it is
unreasonable to demand from them what they have no intention
to supply. Very likely there are passages in this mass, as in
that other of the Orations, which might be adduced: but I am
pretty sure that they would not invalidate the general proposition
that, to Libanius also, those who want literary criticism
proper need not go. Perhaps the nearest approaches to it are
such things as the curious mention to Demetrius (128, Wolf,
p. 67) of parts of an artificial epistolary discourse of his friend’s
which he, Libanius, received when he had pupils with him, and,
after being much bored by their recitations, read to them
instead of lecturing himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The titles at least of his correspondent Themistius<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c008'><sup>[178]</sup></a> are sometimes
a little more promising, and Themistius, a man of considerable
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Themistius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and varied public employment, might
seem less likely to indulge in the excesses of mere
scholastic exercise which Libanius permitted himself. But, on
the whole, we shall have to acknowledge that this other famous
rhetorician also is drawn practically blank for our purpose.
“The Philosopher,” “The Sophist,” “How a man should address
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the public”—these are subjects on which one might surely
think that a little criticism would break in somehow and somewhere.
But it never does. To Themistius, as to so many others,
the great writers of old are persons worthy of infinite respect, to
be quoted freely, but to be quoted as a lawyer quotes this or that
year-book, report, decision, for the substance only. The general
banality of his literary references may be tested by anybody
who chooses to refer to his citations and discussions of various
authors in the <cite>Basanistes</cite> (Orat. xxi., <i>ed. cit.</i> in note, p. 296), or
more succinctly still, to the reference to “golden Menander, and
Euripides, and Sophocles, and fair Sappho, and noble Pindar” in
the pleasant little piece, “To his Father,” which comes before it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is no doubt extremely unjust to argue from the performance
of the pupil to the quality of the teacher; but we may at
least say that, if there was any stronger critical tendency
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Julian.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in Libanius or Themistius than appears in
their own works, it is not reflected in one of their most diligent
and distinguished pupils.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c008'><sup>[179]</sup></a> The references to literature in
the extant works<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c008'><sup>[180]</sup></a> of Julian the Apostate are, in a certain sense
and way, extremely numerous; in fact, it was almost vital to the
odd mixture of dupery and quackery which had mastered him
that he should be constantly quoting classical, if only because
they were heathen, authors. His <cite>Orations</cite><a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c008'><sup>[181]</sup></a> are crammed with
such quotations. Moreover, we have from him a declaration in
form of love for books. “Some,” he says, at the beginning of
his epistle (the ninth) to Ecdicius,<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c008'><sup>[182]</sup></a> “love horses, some birds,
some other beasts; in me from a child there has raged a dire
longing for the possession of books.” But in this, as in other
cases, Desire seems rather to have excluded Criticism. One is
rather annoyed than edified by the banal reference, at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>beginning of the <cite>Misopogon</cite>,<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c008'><sup>[183]</sup></a> to his having seen “the barbarians
beyond the Rhine singing wild songs composed in a speech
resembling the croakings of rough-voiced fowls, and rejoicing in
this music.” If only the princely pedant would have copied a
few of these croaks, and studied them, instead of trying to put
back the clock of the world! His compliments and thanks to
Libanius himself for the above-mentioned speech (Ep. 14) are of
the most hackneyed character. He read it, he says, nearly
all before breakfast, and finished it between breakfast and
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>siesta</i></span>.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c008'><sup>[184]</sup></a> “Thou art blessed to write thus, and still more to be
able to think thus! O speech! O brains! O composition! O
division! O epicheiremes! O <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ordonnance</i></span>! O departures of
style! O harmony! O symphony!” To which we may add
“O <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>clichés</i></span>! O tickets! O [in Mr Burchell’s rudeness] Fudge!”</p>

<p class='c001'>In Ep. 24 there is a playful and pleasant discourse on the
sense of the epithet γλυκὺς given by the poets and others to figs
and honey, but it is only a trifle; and in 34, to Iamblichus, it is
noteworthy how entirely the philosophic interest of literature
overshadows, or rather how completely it blocks out, the literary
whole. In 42, on education, and literature as its instrument,
the old Plutarchian view<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c008'><sup>[185]</sup></a> is refurbished, almost without alteration,
and with only a fling or two at the Galilæans as an
addition; while in 55 Eumenius and Pharianus are explicitly
adjured “not to despise” logic, rhetoric, poetics, to study mathematics
“more carefully,” but to give their whole mind to the
understanding of the dogmas of Aristotle and Plato. This is to
be “the real business, the foundation and the structure and the
roof,” the rest are πάρεργα. The assertion is of course the
reverse of original; but at this juncture it is all the more valuable
to us, as a sort of summary and clincher at once of a large and
important part of ancient opinion. In the borrower of it, as in
those from whom it was borrowed, literary criticism, to full purpose
and with full freedom, simply could not exist.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r58'>58</a>. As in other cases, Theophrastus has
been criticised very largely on rather
slim vouchers. For instance, the quotation
(in Cic. Orat., 39) on the strength
of which Mr. Nettleship, <cite>Lectures and
Essays</cite>, ii. 47, speaks of him complimentarily,
strikes me, I confess, as but
a commonplace remark enough. It is
that by Herodotus and Thucydides,
“History was first stirred up to speak
more freely and ornately.”</p>

represented as a voyager to a far

<p class='c001'><a href='#r126'>126</a>. Spengel’s handy collection (3 vols.,
4 parts), which has now been for some
years in process of re-editing in the
<cite>Bibliotheca Teubneriana</cite> by Römer
and Hammer, omits the scholia on
Hermogenes, but includes divers all-important,
if elsewhere accessible,
texts, such as Aristotle and Longinus,
and adds some minor things.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f127'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r127'>127</a>. It is not, I hope, illiberal to remark
that our excellent “Liddell &amp; Scott”
is perhaps more to seek in rhetorical
terminology than anywhere else. (At
least it certainly was so up to the
7th or penultimate edition: I have
not yet worked with that of 1896.)
Ernesti’s <cite>Lexicon Technologiæ Græcorum
Rhetoricæ</cite> (Leipsic, 1795) is, for
all its 105 years, still almost indispensable
to the student, more so even
than the corresponding and somewhat
younger Latin volume (Leipsic,
1797). Even these fail sometimes.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f128'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r128'>128</a>. He does not give, but Spengel
does, the <cite>Rhetoric to Alexander</cite> (v.

and the same is the case with
a short fragment, Περὶ ἐρωτήσεως καὶ
ἀποκρίσεως, which is an excursus on
Arist., <cite>Rhet.</cite>, iii. 18. It is purely

<p class='c001'><a href='#r130'>130</a>. This  is  an early example of the
confusion and cross-division which has
infested formal Rhetoric to the present
day. For the first three heads are
purely material, the last two grammatical-formal;
so that, instead of ranking
side by side, <em>each</em> of 1, 2, 3 should
rank under <em>each</em> of 4, 5. Cf. Professor
Bain’s <cite>Rhetoric</cite>, vol. i., where similar
cross-division more than once occurs.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f131'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r131'>131</a>. χρεῖαι, rather “maxims” than

<p class='c001'><a href='#r136'>136</a>. δεινὸς and δεινότης are good examples
of the difficulty of getting exact
English equivalents for Greek rhetorical
terms. Some prefer “vehemence” or
“intensity,” but neither of these will
suit universally. The word seems to
refer to the orator’s power of suiting
his method to his case, to alertness
and fertility of resource.</p>

scarce and very dear. Maximus Tyrius

and as for Libanius, Messrs Parker
of Oxford inform me that they have
for years been vainly searching for a
complete copy of Reiske’s edition, while
an incomplete one of which they knew
was snapped up before I could get it.
I can only suppose that the editions
which Reiske himself and Dindorf
edited, at the end of the last century
and early in this, were printed in small
numbers, and have been gradually absorbed
into public libraries. In these
latter I have never myself been able to

then with no comfort. Why Herr
Teubner, the Providence of inopulent

the most difficult. Ed. cit., iii. 788.</p>

<p class='c007'>From a certain point of view, no critical writer of antiquity
has a greater interest than the rhetorician Dionysius of Halicarnassus.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dionysius of Halicarnassus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is true, of course, that this view is at
once strictly limited and decidedly complex. As
Dionysius is not even to be mentioned with Longinus
for what may be called critical inspiration, so he falls
simply out of sight when he is compared with Aristotle in
point of authority, of method, and, above all, of that somewhat
indirect and illegitimate, but real, importance which is derived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>from a long tradition. So, too, there is nothing in him of that
“flash,” that illumination, which we still receive from the turning-on
of the lamp of satiric genius to the critical field by
Lucian, as long before by Aristophanes. But the treatise <cite>On
the Sublime</cite> is, after all, but an inestimable fragment: the loss
to criticism, had the <cite>Rhetoric</cite> and the <cite>Poetics</cite> shared the fate of
some others of their author’s works, would consist partly in
the loss of what has been written about them and in following
of them; while Aristophanes and Lucian are only critics at
intervals and by accident. In Dionysius we have a critic by
profession, and not merely a rhetorician, of whose critical
work an assortment, varied in matter and considerable in bulk,
survives, who had an evident love for his business, and whose
talents for it were very much greater than some authorities
seem willing to allow.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be unnecessary to observe (if there were not a sort
of persons who, in such cases, take the absence of mention for
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His works.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the presence of ignorance) that the work attributed
to Dionysius, and his identity and unity as an author,
have been subjected to the common processes of attempted
disintegration. We are told, as usual, that the works are to be
credited or debited not to one Dionysius, but to two or even
three Dionysii or others; and that individual pieces must or
may be split up into genuine and spurious parts. But this,
besides that it is usual and inevitable, concerns us here little
or not at all. Hardly anything that is about to be said would
have to be altered, if it were quite certain that the critical
works of Dionysius of Halicarnassus were the production of a
whole club of contributors, or had accumulated as the successive
productions of a family of rhetoricians, as long-lived
and pertinacious in Rhetoric as the Monros of Edinburgh in
another art or science. They consist, taking the order of the
edition of Reiske,<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c008'><sup>[186]</sup></a> of a treatise of some length on Composition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>in the literal sense of the putting together of words; of a set
treatise on Rhetoric; of a collection of brief judgments on
the principal authors in Greek, and another of much longer
ones, which is unfortunately not complete, but which contains
elaborate handlings of Lysias, Isocrates, Isæus, and Deinarchus;
of a letter to a certain Ammæus, arguing that Demosthenes was
not indebted to the rhetorical precepts of Aristotle; of another
to Cnæus Pompey on Plato and the Historians; of a second to
Ammæus on the idioms of Thucydides; of a celebrated and
interesting examination, at great length, of the chief historians
of Greece; and of another, also well known, which is usually
quoted by its Latin title, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Admiranda Vi dicendi Demosthenis</cite></span>,
where δεινότης, perhaps, might be more properly translated “Of
Demosthenes' oratorical resourcefulness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of these the least interesting by far is the professed <cite>Rhetoric</cite>:
and it is with the less reluctance that we may resign it to those
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Rhetoric.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
who pronounce it, in whole or in part, spurious. It
opens, in the very worst and most sterile form of
the ancient Rhetoric, by a series of chapters on the different
commonplaces available for orations on different stock subjects
and occasions,—a panegyric, a marriage, a birthday, a
funeral, an exhortation to athletes—things trite and obvious
to desperation, the very cabbage of the schools, the opprobrium
of all ancient literature, though perhaps not worse than our own
frantic efforts to avoid the obvious. It passes to the favourite
sub-subject of the Figures, but does not treat these in the worst
way, gives the usual, chiefly poetical, illustrations, and concludes
with observations on the (again usual) subdivisions of
the matter. There is nothing in it that is original and nothing
that is characteristic, and the most Dionysian traits, such as
the curious stress laid upon the Herodotean episode of Gyges,
might as well have been copied by an imitator as duplicated
by the author himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remaining works are much better and much more important.
It is true that the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Compositione</cite></span> (as its title
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Composition.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
honestly holds forth) belongs to the lower, not the
higher, division of the school-grouping of the subject—to
Composition, not to Rhetoric. But proper Composition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>even in the school sense, is the necessary vestibule of style;
and, until attention has been paid to it, there is no hope of
anything further that shall be of real use in literary criticism.
And it is also not only something, but a great thing,
to make an advance upon that (one had but for a sacred
shame, almost said) ignorant and unintelligent contempt of
words as words which we find in Aristotle himself. Dionysius
indeed, as in duty bound, glances at the contempt of <i>lexis</i> which
the great Master of the Walk had made fashionable. It is true,
he says, that boys are caught by the bloom of style, but it takes
the experience of years to judge it rightly. And he promises a
supplementary treatise <cite>On the Choice of Words</cite>, which we should
be very glad to possess. But for the present he is busied, not
with their choice, but with their arrangement after they are
chosen; and he deals with this partly by positive precept, but
chiefly by the use of examples, from Homer in poetry and
Herodotus in prose. Dionysius was a fervent devotee of his
admirable countryman, allowing his devotion, indeed, to carry
him to the length of distinct injustice to that countryman’s
great rival Thucydides; but it has here inspired him well
enough. And Homer could not lead him wrong; though
perhaps we may note here, as elsewhere with the ancients,
a distinctly insufficient appreciation of the differences between
poetry and prose. He begins quite at the beginning with the
letters, touches on onomatop&oelig;ia—that process which the great
poetic languages like Greek and English admit so readily, and
of which the less poetic like Latin and French are so afraid—and
on the practice (of which, like a true critic, he has no fear)
of reviving archaisms when desirable. Then he attacks the
question how beautiful diction and composition are to be
attained. Here again, and necessarily, he proceeds more by
example than by precept, for indeed precept, of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>
kind, is in these matters mostly valueless. But one sentence
(p. 96, Reiske) is worth quoting at length, because it puts boldly
the truth which Aristotle had evaded or pooh-poohed in his
excessive devotion to the philosophy of literature rather than
to literature itself: “So that it is necessary that that diction
should be beautiful in which there are beautiful words, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>that of beautiful words beautiful syllables and letters are the
cause.” Dionysius knew this, as Longinus knew it three
hundred, as Dante knew it thirteen hundred, years after him:
but, six hundred years after Dante, there are still persons who
seem to regard the fact as somehow or other degrading.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he goes to what even Aristotle had not disdained,—though,
in common with Dionysius himself, Quintilian,
and others, he speaks on the subject in terms not easy for
modern comprehension,—the rhythmical adjustment of prose
as well as of verse, admitting even in Thucydides, to whom
he is as a rule not too just, an abundant possession of this
gift of rhythm.</p>

<p class='c001'>A very striking passage, and the oldest of its kind, occurs at
p. 133, R, in which Dionysius declares his own conviction that
the style is noblest of all which has greatest variety, most
frequent changes of harmony, most transitions from periodic
to extra-periodic arrangement, most alternations of short and
long clauses, rapid and slow movements, and greatest shift of
rhythmical valuation. For we must remember that, even after
the advances which the study of seventeenth- and the practice
of nineteenth-century writers have made in English prose
rhythm, it can probably never attain to the formal particularity—I
do not say perfection—of Greek. We cannot—at least the
present writer, who has been told that he has no ill ear, cannot—appreciate
the effect of a dochmiac as a single foot; it is
hard to do more than guess at the effect on a Greek of the use
of the different pæons; and in at least one famous passage of
Quintilian all candid moderns have confessed themselves
baffled.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c008'><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>His Pindaric example is interesting because it is about the
only considerable fragment which we have of the master’s
Dithyrambic writing.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c008'><sup>[188]</sup></a> His Thucydidean specimen is the
well-known proem to the History. The criticism of the Pindaric
extract may seem to modern readers a rather odd <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pot-pourri</i></span>
of merely grammatical or linguistic, and of strictly
critical, observations. Thus Dionysius observes that the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>member<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c008'><sup>[189]</sup></a> consists of four parts of speech: a verb, two nouns, and
a “conjunction” (he expressly, in another passage, intimates
doubts whether this or “preposition” is the proper word to use),
and then, after this mere “parsing,” handles the construction of
the phrase and the juxtaposition of it, attributing a certain
designed discord or clash as the general motive of the piece.
And he recognises the same clash in the Thucydidean passage,
in which, while (like a rhetorician as he is) half regretting the
absence of panegyric and theatrical grace, he admits “an archaic
and headstrong beauty,”<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c008'><sup>[190]</sup></a> supporting this general verdict with
the same minute examination as before. Next he quotes
Sappho’s great hymn to Aphrodite, as Longinus was afterwards
to quote its greater companion, allowing (and no wonder!)
felicity of diction and grace to this in the fullest degree. And
later he occupies a good deal of space with those approximations
between oratory and poetry, which may seem to us otiose,
but which have more than one good side, the best of all
perhaps being the fact that they induced critics, as in the
instances referred to, to quote, and so preserve, precious fragments
which we should otherwise have lost.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, this treatise, if studied carefully, must raise
some astonishment that Dionysius should have been spoken of
disrespectfully by any one who himself possesses competence
in criticism. A good deal of the work is, no doubt, for us, a
little out of fashion; the traditional technicalities seem jejune;
the processes are out of date. Yet, from more points of
view than one, the piece gives Dionysius no mean rank as a
critic. To those who want characteristic aspects, aspects put in
striking phrase, that attribution of “headstrong beauty” to
Thucydides should excuse a good deal: that is no mere dead
ticket of the schools. To the more methodical critic of criticism
the minute processes of investigation, the careful estimate
of the incidence of such a sound in such and such a position,
even the mere parsing view of clauses and sentences, are things
themselves worthy of minute study. And it is not only fair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>but no more than necessary, to remember that this, after all, is
only a treatise on a certain aspect or department of criticism,
and that we have no right to demand from it more than satisfactory
treatment of its special subject—the “composition,”
the symphonic arrangement of words and the elements of
words. To some moderns Dionysius may seem too attentive to
mint and anise and cumin; but he would have no great difficulty
in retorting equally contemptuous comparisons for the
windy generalisations on one hand, and the sheer neglect of all
minutiæ of form on the other, which characterise too much
modern critical work.</p>

<p class='c001'>The short “censures” of ancient writers have, perhaps, an
interest of curiosity greater than their interest of value. It is
<span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Censures and Commentaries on Orators, &amp;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
not improbable that they served as a pattern to
Quintilian, who often suggests a knowledge of
Dionysius.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c008'><sup>[191]</sup></a> But though they are ushered in with
some quite irreproachable commonplaces as to the
excellence of contemplating excellent models, they are themselves,
at least sometimes, too brief, and too specifically sententious,
to have much intrinsic interest or much teaching power.
We are not greatly advanced in the understanding of Hesiod,
whether we have read him or not, by being told that he paid
attention to pleasure, and the smoothness of words, and harmonious
composition. Nor can any of the poetical labels of our
Halicarnassian be said to be very much more informing, while
in dramatic writers he does not go beyond “The Three,” and
has little to tell us that is newer than the tolerably obvious
things that Æschylus is magnificent in his language, Sophocles
noble in his characterisation, Euripides questionable in both.
The historians he treats at first in contrasted pairs—Herodotus
and Thucydides, of course, Philistus and Xenophon,—then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Theopompus alone. The philosophers he polishes off in a combined
paragraph of a dozen lines, which hardly attempts to be
characteristic save in the case of Aristotle. And then, with a
half apology for so summarily despatching these, he turns, as to
his proper business, to the orators. But even here we have
mere summary, and must turn to the far fuller, but, unluckily,
not quite complete, <cite>Commentaries</cite> on the same subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>These, addressed to his favourite correspondent Ammæus,
begin with the familiar complaint (which no critical experience
of the past ever drives from a critic’s mouth) about the badness
of the literary times. The good old Attic Muse herself, like a
neglected wife, is insulted, deprived of her rights, and even
menaced in her existence, by impudent foreign baggages, Phrygian,
or Carian, or Barbarian out and out. But we are rather
surprised (till we remember that Dionysius was a settler at
Rome, and that it was his interest, if not to do as the Romans
did, at any rate to please them) to hear that things are improving,
owing to the good sense of the governors of the Roman
state, itself the governess of the world. There is some hope
that this “senseless eloquence will not last for another generation.”<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c008'><sup>[192]</sup></a>
And Dionysius will do what he can to help the good
work by a study of the six greatest of the old Attic orators,
Lysias, Isocrates, Isæus, Demosthenes, Hyperides, Æschines.
Unluckily we only have the first three of these, though a judgment
of Deinarchus, not promised, exists, and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Admiranda
Vi</cite></span> supplies the gap, as far as Demosthenes goes, in even
fuller measure than in proportion to the others. We may as
well take these and other things together, in order to have
something like a conspectus of the case before summing up
the critical characteristics of this most interesting critic.</p>

<p class='c001'>If they are somewhat disappointing, this (to borrow the convenient
bull) is not much more than we might have expected.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The minor works.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Admiranda Vi</cite></span> is by far the best of them,
and contains a great deal of excellent criticism, both
particular and general. But the orators had already for
centuries been the very parade-ground of Rhetoric; and as
paradoxical excursions from orthodox limits were, though by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>no means unknown to the ancients, not in great favour with
them, everything that was likely to be said of the Ten was
trite and hackneyed. The smaller epistles and the judgment
of Thucydides (perverse as this last exploit is) are, on the whole,
more interesting. The little paper on the <cite>Rhetoric</cite> of Aristotle
and the Speeches of Demosthenes, arguing that the latter are
anterior to the former, is of a kind with which modern times
are only too familiar, but displays none of the puerility and
false logic which, in our modern instances, that familiarity has
taught us to associate with the kind. The contention is undoubtedly
sound: the handling is reasonable, and the whole
makes us distinctly sorry that Dionysius, who had access to so
much that we have lost, did not write a complete <cite>History of
Greek Literature</cite>, which would have been invaluable, instead of
his <cite>History of Rome</cite>, which we could have done without, though
it is far from valueless. As it is, this is one of the few important
contributions to such a history that we possess, of really
ancient date. If he is less happy in the judgment of Plato,
inserted (with some on the historians) in the letter to Cnæus
Pompey, this is principally due to that horror of poetic prose, of
dithyrambic expression, which (perhaps for better reasons than
we know) was then creeping over criticism, and which we shall
find dominant in critical, though not in popular, estimate during
the earlier centuries of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second epistle to Ammæus seems to be one of the latest
of the numerous utterances of Dionysius on the great Athenian
historian. It is somewhat meticulous and verbal; but it is
curious that the just-mentioned horror of gorgeousness reappears
in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>And so we come to the famous onslaught in form against
the son of Olorus. It is introduced by a somewhat elaborate
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The judgment of Thucydides.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
apology—the critic going so far as to shelter himself
under the leading case of Aristotle <i>v.</i> Plato. Thence
he passes to a short sketch of the predecessors of
Thucydides in history, commends him for dropping their
fables, &amp;c., but soon settles down to a regular <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>éreintement</i></span>—a
“slating” criticism of the familiar type, wherein the desire to
“dust the varlet’s jacket” is evidently not merely superior but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>anterior to any desire whatsoever to criticise varlet or jacket
on the merits of either. The division into winters and summers,
the setting forth of the causes of the war, the conduct
and details of the story, the speeches—all come in for reprehension.
But Dionysius is, as we should expect from his other
handlings, much kinder to the style, though he objects to its
occasional obscurity, urges difficulties on the score of the
Figures, criticises some passages at great length, and ends by
noticing the chief of the historian’s imitators, among whom he
includes Demosthenes. On the whole, the article (as we may
call it), though one-sided, is less so than some current descriptions
of it may have conveyed to those who have not read it.
But still it belongs to the class of critiques indicated above, a
class in which few of the best examples of criticism are to be
found, except from the point of view of those who hold the true
business of that art to be, like the “backward voice” of Trinculo-Caliban,
“to utter foul speeches and to detract.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, on the whole, it need not interfere with the emphatic
repetition of the opinion, with the expression of which this
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>General critical value.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
notice of the Halicarnassian began, that he is a very
considerable critic, and one to whom justice has not
usually, if at all, yet been done. Great as is the place
which he gives to oratory, there is no ancient writer (except
Longinus) who seems so free from the intention to allow it any
really mischievous primacy. If he is, as might be expected
from a teacher, sometimes a little meticulous in his philology
and lower Rhetoric, yet this very attention to detail saves him
from the distinctly unfortunate and rather unphilosophical
superciliousness of Aristotle towards style, and from the
equally unfortunate divagation, both of that great man and of
all his followers, into questions vaguely æsthetic instead of questions
definitely literary. The error which, at the new birth
of criticism in Europe, was so lucklessly reintroduced and
exaggerated by the Italian critics of the sixteenth century—the
error of wool-gathering after abstract questions of the
nature and justification of poetry, of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> rules suitable
for poetic forms, of Unities, and so forth—meets very little
encouragement from Dionysius, and it is perhaps for this very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>reason that he has been slighted by high-flying æstheticians.
Not thus will the wiser mind judge him, but as a critic who
saw far, and for the most part truly, into the proper province
of literary criticism—that is to say, the reasonable enjoyment of
literary work and the reasonable distribution of that work into
good, not so good, and bad. Here, and not in the Laputan
<i>meteorosophia</i> of theories of poetry, is criticism’s main work; not
that she may not justly imp her wings for a higher flight now
and then, but that she must beware of flapping them in the
inane.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the opinions of the criticism of the critical power and
position of Dionysius of Halicarnassus have varied rather
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Plutarch.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
strangely, those uttered concerning Plutarch as
a critic are still more irreconcilable. For he
has not only been casually suggested but elaborately championed<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c008'><sup>[193]</sup></a>
as a candidate for the signal honour of the authorship
of the Περὶ Ὕψους—that is to say, as one capable of producing
what is perhaps the critical masterpiece of antiquity,
and certainly one of the few critical masterpieces of the world.
From this one would be prepared to expect at least very strong
evidences of critical faculty, and some noteworthy pieces of
critical accomplishment, in his extant works, which, it must
be remembered, are extremely voluminous, and of a character
remarkably well suited for the exercise of literary criticism.
The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vitæ Parallelæ</cite></span> at least <em>might</em> have been frequently directed
in this way; while the enormous miscellany of the <cite>Moralia</cite>
corresponds more closely to the “Essays” of modern writers
than any collection of the kind that we have from ancient
times. Now, it is hardly necessary to say that the modern
Essay has from the very first set strongly in the literary direction,
and that up to the present time the amount of literary
criticism, in essay form, is probably not less, while the value
of it is infinitely greater, than that of all the formal treatises
and non-essay-fashioned handlings of the subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>On turning to the <cite>Lives</cite> we meet with an almost complete
disappointment. If it be said that Plutarch’s object was to
give us contrasts of practical men—soldiers and statesmen, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>philosophers or men of letters—that is, no doubt, a valid
answer as far as it goes, though it would scarcely be unfair to
argue from the fact that, at any rate, matters literary were not
of the first importance to him. But in one famous instance, the
parallel of Demosthenes and Cicero, he not only had a most
proper opportunity for dealing with the subject, but was almost
obliged to deal with it. It must therefore be worth while to
look at his dealing.</p>

<p class='c001'>He begins the “Demosthenes” with an excuse for his small
knowledge of Latin, and makes this a pretext for deliberately
excluding all literary and even all oratorical comparison
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Lives <i>quite barren for us</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of the two. Nay, he goes further, and
actually upbraids Cæcilius (apparently the same
person whose treatment of the Sublime Longinus did not like)
with having made this. After such a refusal it is surely idle to
contend for any real or strong literary and critical <i>nisus</i> in the
agreeable moralist and biographer of Chæronea. Had there
been any such tendency in him, he simply could not have
avoided such a palmary occasion of giving it course. Even if
he really considered himself incompetent to deliver an opinion
of Cicero, he would have had something to say about Demosthenes
even if this declared incompetence was only a disguise
for the reluctance to treat Latin literature seriously, which is
so noticeable in Greeks, this would not invalidate the reasoning.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us, however, for the sake of the argument, and out of
pure generosity, accept his excuse, put the <cite>Lives</cite> out of the
question, and turn to the <cite>Moralia</cite>.<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c008'><sup>[194]</sup></a> As has been
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Moralia <i>at first sight promising</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
said above, if we do not find literary criticism, and
good literary criticism, in such a collection of a
man’s work, it must be either because he has no taste for it,
or because he has the taste without the faculty. For the
collection is very large, and it is almost absolutely miscellaneous:
the mere title <i>Moralia</i> is nothing more than an
unauthorised ticket, and has really nothing to do with the
contents. Neither Montaigne nor De Quincey takes a more
absolute liberty of speaking on any subject that happens to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>strike his fancy than Plutarch. And it cannot be said that
at least some of his subjects are without direct connection with
criticism. The two opening papers, “On the Education of
Children” and "How a young man should read [“listen to,”
literally, but this means what we mean by "read"] the Poets,"
would seem, the one almost necessarily (considering the humanism
of ancient education), and the other inevitably, to lead to
the subject. The next on “Hearing” (<i>i.e.</i>, “Reading”) generally,
might even seem to strengthen the necessity. Many of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Examination of this promise.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
other titles are promising, and, both in the nature
of the case and from what we know of the general
course of ancient table-talk, the bulky volume of
<cite>Symposiac Questions</cite> might seem likely to be most prolific,
while it is actually not infertile in matter of our kind. Let
us examine what is the performance of these promises.</p>

<p class='c001'>Englishmen, and especially students of English literature,
ought to take no mean interest in the tractate on Education,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The “Education.”</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
if only for the reason that it had a most powerful
influence on the great Elizabethan age, both directly
and through the medium of Lyly’s <cite>Euphues</cite>, which is in part<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c008'><sup>[195]</sup></a>
almost a translation of it. But though, not merely for this but
other more intrinsic reasons, the treatise <em>is</em> interesting, it is not
of much good to us. In fact, it is scarcely a paradox to say that
it is one of its merits not to be of much good to us. It is a
truism that the very noblest characteristic of Greek education,
a characteristic never fully recovered since, was its combination
of high literary ideas with the most perfect and practical recognition
of the fact that book-education by itself is education of
the most wretchedly inadequate character. Plutarch (and
again it is much to his credit) thoroughly shared this view—so
thoroughly that he begins his treatise a little before the
birth of the children to be educated, and continues it (quite in
the Rousseau style) by insisting that mothers shall suckle their
own offspring. From the first the importance of inculcating
good habits, of not telling children immoral or silly stories, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>being careful in the selection of nurses and tutors,—this is
the thing that Plutarch busies himself about. He will have
them learn all the usual arts and sciences, but he dwells on
these very little. How to give them good morals and healthy
bodies; how to keep them or wean them from bad company
and foul language; how to practise them in manly sports and
exercises—these are Plutarch’s cares. Excellent, nay! thrice
excellent preoccupation! but it necessarily makes the treatise
of no use to <em>us</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>No one can reasonably blame its author for this, especially as
he seems likely to fill up the gap in the two following Essays.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Papers on “Reading.”</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
“How a young man should read Poetry” is a title
which would serve well for the very best and most
stimulating critical observations of a Coleridge or an
Arnold; or to go nearer to its own times, it might really do for
an alternative heading to the Περὶ Ὕψους itself. Yet we very
soon see—and we must know our Plutarch very little if we do
not <i>fore</i>see it—that the ethical preoccupation is just as supreme
and exclusive here. The piece is in itself an interesting one,
and preserves for us a large number of quotations, some of
which are unique. But Plutarch’s handling of them is as
little literary as he can make it. You cannot (he tells his
friend Marcus Sedatus with a kind of gloomy resignation)
prevent clever boys from reading poetry, so you must make
the best of it. It is like the head of an octopus, very nice
to eat, nourishing enough, but apt to give restless and fantastic
dreams. So you must be careful to administer pædagogic
correctives, and to put the right meaning on dangerous things,
like the account of Helen’s complaisance to Paris after his disgraceful
flight from battle, and of Hera’s bewitching Zeus with
the aid of the Cestus. This kind of thing runs throughout the
piece—the most famous certainly, and perhaps the most diverting
instance of Plutarch’s mania for moralising, being his dealing
with the delightful passage of the meeting of Nausicaa and
Odysseus. He does not indeed go the entire length of the neo-classical
critics of the French school as to this gem. He only
says that <em>if</em> the Princess fell in love with Odysseus at first
sight, her boldness and impudence are very shocking. But if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>she perceived what a sensible man he was, and preferred him to
some rich dandy of her fellow-citizens, it was most creditable.
It is not of course worth while to waste any good indignation,
or any otherwise utilisable scorn, upon this priggish silliness, the
dregs of older Platonism-and-water, the caricature and reduction-to-the-absurd
of a confusion only too common among
ancient critics, and not quite unknown among modern. It is
only necessary to point out that, from a man capable of it, good
literary criticism would be surprising, and that as a matter of
fact there is here no strictly literary criticism at all. The paper
ends as it began, with the general doctrine that the young must
be well steered in their reading, so that they may be kindly
handed on by Poetry to Philosophy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The more general tract, “How one should [hear or] read,” is
shorter, has few quotations or none, and is less obtrusively
moral in tone. But it still regards hearing, or reading, not in
any way as the means of enjoying an artistic pleasure, but as
the means of acquiring or failing to acquire information or
edification. You must listen (or read) attentively: not take
unreasonable likes and dislikes, excessive admirations and contempts.
You must more particularly <em>not</em> take special pleasure
in style and phrase. (Here we come not so much to neglect of
literary criticism as to positive blasphemy against it.) A man
who will not attend to a useful statement, because its style is
not Attic, is like a man who refuses a wholesome drug because
it is not offered him in Attic pottery. Later, there are some
remarks on actual tricks of style. But, on the whole, it would
be possible for a man to be educated, to live his life, carefully
observing the precepts of this little batch of tracts, and to die
a most respectable person, after perhaps having lived a happy
and useful life, yet never to know or to care whether or why
Plato was a better prose-writer than any tenth-rate sophist,
Tennyson a better poet than Tom Sternhold or Tom Shadwell.</p>

<p class='c001'>Turn to the <cite>Lives of the Orators</cite>.<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c008'><sup>[196]</sup></a> There is no question here,
under the head of Demosthenes, of any inability to understand
Latin; and the various styles of the famous Ten might have
tempted most, and did tempt many, Greeks to indulge in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>literary analysis and literary comparison. In the tractate
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Lives of the Orators.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
before us, be it Plutarch’s or be it somebody else’s,
the author avoids touching upon even the fringe of
the literary part of his subject with an ingenuity
that is quite marvellous, or a stolidity that is more marvellous
still. All these great masters of Greek might be generals or
mere jurists, sculptors or fishmongers, for any allusion that he
makes to the means by which they won their fame.</p>

<p class='c001'>Everybody hopes that Plutarch did not write the <cite>Malignity
of Herodotus</cite>.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c008'><sup>[197]</sup></a> But somebody wrote it: and while the general
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Malignity of Herodotus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
handling is by no means alien from Plutarch’s the
tractate, even if apocryphal, very adequately represents
the attitude of no inconsiderable section of
Greek men of letters to literature. Silly as it is, it illustrates
rather usefully the curious <em>parochiality</em> of the Greeks, to some
extent visible even at their best time, but naturally far more
noticeable when that best time was over. Herodotus spoke
disrespectfully of B&oelig;otians: Plutarch was a B&oelig;otian; woe to
Herodotus. This kind of attitude is strange to Englishmen,
who generally think far too well of themselves and their country
to care what any poor outside creature says of it or them.
But it is not unknown in some of the less predominant partners
of the associated British Empire; it is notoriously very strong
in America; and it is the rule, rather than the exception, on the
Continent of Europe. It is, however, perhaps the worst mood
in the world for literary criticism; and Plutarch, never strong
there, is never weaker than here. He lets slip indeed, at the
beginning, an interesting admission that Herodotus was generally
thought to combine, with other good qualities, a peculiar
facility in the reading of men, and a fluent pen. This is a
literary criticism, and we may expect it to be met with retort in
kind. But it is the nasty underhand temper that he wishes to
exhibit. Herodotus, it seems, always uses the most damaging
expressions; he drags in people’s misdeeds when they have
nothing to do with the story, he omits their merits, he takes
the worst views when more charitable ones were possible, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>so forth. Which general charges are supported by an ostensibly
careful examination of particular passages throughout
the history. Comparisons complimentary to Thucydides are
often made, but of the literary differences of the two great
historians there is scarcely a word. Only at the end, as at
the beginning, there is a curious kind of extorted confession.
The pen is graphic and the style is sweet, and there is grace
and freshness and cleverness in the narrative. But you must
take heed of his κακοήθεια as of a Spanish fly among roses.

though only an extract or abstract, may
seem as if it could not deceive us. That the result
is the depreciation of the greater writer and the
exaltation of the smaller one does not matter much:
we must not judge a critic by our agreement with the <em>sense</em> of
his criticism. And it may be admitted that the technicalities
of the art, which in other places are always incomprehensibly
absent, do put in some appearance here. But though there is even
some critical jargon,<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c008'><sup>[199]</sup></a> there is no critical grasp. We are told with
a shower of additional epithets that Aristophanes is φορτικὸς
καὶ θυμελικὸς καὶ βάναυσος, the first and last of these words
corresponding to different sides of our “vulgar,” while the second
means “smacking of the <i>thymele</i>,” “theatrical,” “stagey”; that
Menander’s style is “one, despite its variety,” free from puns
and other naughty things. But here also the ethical side is
what really engages the critic. Aristophanes is harsh, he is
shocking, he degrades his subjects; Menander is graceful, full
of instructive sentiment and common-sense. And the genius?
Plutarch is quite frank on that point. He says, καὶ οὐκ οιδ' ὲν
οἷς ἔστιν ἡ θρυλουμένη δεξιότης—"I really don’t know where
the much-talked-of cleverness comes in." Alas! that “speaks”
him.</p>

<p class='c001'>No different conclusion will be reached wherever we look in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>the great collection of the <i>Moralia</i>. Take, for instance, the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Roman Questions.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<cite>Roman Questions</cite>.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c008'><sup>[200]</sup></a> It may be said that these are
confessedly <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in alia materia</i></span>, but the objection is
hasty. We have seen that Plutarch, in the preface to his <cite>Lives</cite>
of Demosthenes and Cicero, pleads his scanty acquaintance with
Latin as an excuse for not attempting one of the most obvious
and interesting of things, one, moreover, almost peremptorily
demanded of him—that is to say, the literary comparison of the
two greatest orators, of two of the greatest prose writers, of
Greece and Rome respectively. Yet we see from these <cite>Roman
Questions</cite> that, when the subject really interested him, he could
pry into Latin matters, of the obscurest and most out-of-the-way
kind, with unwearied labour and curiosity, and with a great
deal of acuteness to boot. Not an eccentric rite of Latin
religion, not a quaint bit of Latin folk-lore, not a puzzling social
custom at Rome, can he meet with and hear of, but he hunts up
the history and literature of it, turns it over and over in his
mind, has traditional or conjectural explanations of it, treats it
with all the affectionate diligence of the critical commentator.
And yet he is afraid or indisposed to attempt a literary estimate
of the authors of the two <cite>Philippics</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The much larger <cite>Symposiacs</cite><a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c008'><sup>[201]</sup></a> tell the same story, no longer
indirectly, but, as it were, aloud and open-mouthed. There are
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Symposiacs.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
nine books of them; ten or a dozen questions, sometimes
more, are discussed in each book, often at considerable
length. Table-talk among the Greeks and Romans
was notoriously inclined in a literary direction.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c008'><sup>[202]</sup></a> But Plutarch’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>table-talk is nothing so little as it is literary. The
customs and etiquette of conviviality; the proceedings, proper
or not proper, at and after a good dinner; the physical qualities
of foods and wines, receive natural, full, and curious treatment.
Sometimes the writer allows his fancy the remotest excursions,
as in the famous debate whether the bird comes before the egg
or the egg before the bird. He discusses philosophy, physics,
physic; he inquires whether sea-water will or (like a more
sophisticated product) will not wash clothes; appraises the
quality of jests; considers whether meat gets high sooner in
moonlight or sunlight; and whether there is more echo by day
or by night. But amid all this expatiation he seems to avoid
literature as if it were Scylla and Charybdis in one. If he
draws anywhere near the subject, it is to treat it in the least
literary way possible. We see the name of Homer in the title
of a chapter, and begin to hope for something to our point. But
Plutarch is only anxious to know why, when Homer mentions
games, he puts boxing first, then wrestling, and running
last. We find in one of the prefaces (that to Book V.) a scornful
glance at φορτικοὶ καὶ ἀφιλόλογοι, who tell riddles and so
forth after dinner. But, alas! the book itself practises “Philology”
in a way that is of very little good to us. It does
indeed open with the old and still unsettled question why the
dramatic and literary treatment of painful things is pleasant;
but this is a question rather of philosophy than of literature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>It starts the inquiry whether prizes for poetry at festivals are of
great antiquity; but this is mere antiquarianism. When it is
for a moment actually “philological,” inquiring into epithets
like ζωρότερον and ἀγλαόκαρπον and ὑπέρφλοια, it is always
the bare meaning, the application, and so forth, that is attended
to. When, for instance, Plutarch discusses the second word, he
does not so much as touch that general question of Greek compound
epithets which Mr Matthew Arnold touches (and begs)
in a well-known passage.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c008'><sup>[203]</sup></a> He does not even glance at the
grace, the beauty, the harmony of the word itself. He only
wants to know why the poet specially applies this term to
apple-trees, and why Empedocles selects apples themselves for
the other epithet, ὑπέρφλοια. Nay, in discussing this last he
gives a kind of indirect slap at the notion of an epithet being
selected for the sake of “pretty writing and blooming colour.”<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c008'><sup>[204]</sup></a>
And so everywhere. It is not too much to say that Plutarch
<em>invariably</em> avoids when he can, and when he accidentally
approaches it, despatches in as unliterary a manner as possible,
the business of the literary critic. If he does not (as there is
some warrant for thinking he did) positively undervalue and
almost despise this, he clearly regards it as something for which
he himself has no vocation and in which he feels no interest.
And then they make him the author of the Περὶ Ὕψους!</p>

<p class='c001'>To say that Lucian<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c008'><sup>[205]</sup></a> is the Aristophanes of post-Christian
Greek may seem a feeble and obvious attempt at epigram.
But, so far as criticism is concerned, it has a propriety
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lucian.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which takes it out of the category of the
forcible-feeble. Not only are the two writers alike (giving
weight for age) in the purity of their respective styles; not
only are they alike in the all-dissolving irony and the staunch
Toryism of their satire on innovations; but their critical
attitudes are (when once more due allowance has been made
for circumstances and seasons) curiously similar. Neither is
a literary critic first of all or by profession,—though Lucian’s
date, the state of literature in his time, and his being in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>main a prose writer, give him a sort of “false air” of being
this. Both dislike innovations of phrase, at least as much
because they are innovations as because they are actually
in bad taste. Both hate “conceit,” and neologism, at least
as vehemently because such things happen to be associated
with opinions obnoxious to them as because they dislike
the things themselves. And consequently (though again, for
reasons easily given, less apparently in Lucian’s case than
in Aristophanes), the critical work of both, though displaying
astonishing acuteness, is rather a special phase, a particular
function of a general attitude of satiric contemplation of
life, than criticism pure and simple. In both, yet again, the
combination of critical temperament and literary power makes
what they have to say on the subject of extraordinary interest.
Yet once more, in this case as in the former, the
interest lies a little outside the path of strict criticism.
What Lucian has to tell us is perhaps best, as it is certainly
most memorably, summed up in the epigram attributed to
him (and I am sure not unworthily) in the <cite>Anthology</cite>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Lucian wrote this, knowing old things and vain—</div>

<p class='c019'>We do not get much beyond this cheerful doctrine in his
more directly critical utterances. Much acuteness has been
ascribed to the πῶς δεῖ ἱστορίαν συγγράφειν.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c008'><sup>[207]</sup></a> But one had
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> How to Write History.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
hardly need be a Lucian to see that the historian
(or anybody else) must understand his subject,
and know how to set it forth: though it may be
very freely granted that a strict application of the doctrine
would make considerable gaps on the shelves of libraries,
or rather would leave very few books on them. Indeed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>whole tractate, though very sound sense, is in more ways than
one a prologue to the <cite>True History</cite>. And from its opening
account of the unlucky Abderites and their epidemic of
tragedy, through its application of the story of Diogenes
rolling his tub, to its demure assertion at the end that the
tub <em>is</em> rolled, the irony is sufficiently apparent.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the “How to Write History” is chiefly concerned with
matter, the <cite>Lexiphanes</cite><a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c008'><sup>[208]</sup></a> is, with at least equal thoroughness, devoted
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Lexiphanes.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to words. The comedy here is of a different kind, broader,
but hardly less subtle. The play on αὐχμὸς (“dry”) and
νεοχμὸς (“newfangled”), the taste which Lexiphanes gives at
once of his preciousness by the use of the word κυψελόβυστα
(“wax-stuffed”), his superb contempt for irony,<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c008'><sup>[209]</sup></a> with his interlocutor’s
audacious punning and sham reverence, “set” the
piece at once for us. The wonderful lingo which Lexiphanes
proceeds to pour forth in his “Anti-symposium”
is matter for another inquiry than this; but the
subsequent criticism of it by Lycinus and Sopolis is quite
within our competence. And there is nowhere any sounder
prophylactic against one of the recurrent diseases of literature,
an access of which has been on us, as it happens, for a considerable
time past. There are other diseases, of course—affected
archaism, affected purism, &amp;c. But this particular
one of “raising language to a higher power,” as it has been
called by some of those afflicted (and pleased) with it in our
days, has never been better characterised. “Before all things,”
says Lycinus, “prythee remember me this, not to mimic the
worst inventions of modern rhetoricians, and smack your lips
over them,<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c008'><sup>[210]</sup></a> but to trample on them, and emulate the great
classical examples. Nor let the wind-flowers of speech bewitch
you, but, after the manner of men in training, stick to solid
food. Sacrifice first of all to the Goddess Clearness and to the
Graces by whom you are quite deserted. Bid avaunt! to bombast
and magniloquence, to tricks of speech. Do not turn up your
nose, and strain your voice, and jeer at others, and think that
carping at everybody else will put yourself in the front rank.
Nay, you have another fault, not small, but perhaps your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>greatest, that you do not first arrange the meaning of your
expressions, and then dress them up in word and phrase; but
if you can pick up anywhere some outlandish locution, or
invent one that seems pretty to you, you try to tack a meaning
on to it, and are miserable if you cannot stuff it in somewhere,
though it may have no necessary connection with what you have
to say.”<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c008'><sup>[211]</sup></a> It would be impossible to put more forcibly or better
the necessary caution, the Devil’s Advocate’s plea, against
the abuse and exaggeration of the doctrine of the “beautiful
word.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The “Indictment of the Vowels”<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c008'><sup>[212]</sup></a> is rather a grammatical
and rhetorical <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>jeu d’esprit</i></span> than a criticism; but if the curious
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Other pieces: The</i> Prometheus Es.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
little piece, “To one who said 'You are the Prometheus
of Prose,'”<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c008'><sup>[213]</sup></a> were a little longer and more
explicit, it would give us rather a firmer hold of
Lucian’s serious views of literature than we have actually got.
At first he plays, in his usual manner, with the notion of his
real or invented flatterer. Are his works called Promethean
because they are of clay? He sorrowfully admits the justice
of the comparison. Or because they are so clever? This is sarcastic;
and besides he has no wish to deserve the Caucasus.
After all, too, it is a dubious compliment, for did not a comic
writer call Cleon “a Prometheus”? Then he drolls variously
on the “potter’s art” attributed to him, the slightness of his
work, the ease with which it can be smashed, &amp;c. But, perhaps
there <em>is</em> a complimentary meaning—that Lucian, like
Prometheus, is an inventor—that his books are not merely to
pattern. He does not altogether reject the soft impeachment,
though he hastens (in harmony with that conclusion of the
<cite>Lexiphanes</cite> which has been just quoted) to say that mere
novelty is no merit in his eyes. And this he proceeds to illustrate,
in his own manner, by a story of the black camel and the
magpie-coloured man that Ptolemy brought to Egypt, with the
result that the Egyptians thought the camel frightful and the
magpie-man a rather disgusting joke. But he has, he admits,
attempted to adjust the philosophical dialogue to something
like the tone of the comic poets, to avoid the faults of both,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>and to adjust their excellences. At any rate, says he, with
one of his inimitable changes, Prometheus was a thief, and
he, Lucian, is not. Nobody can call him a plagiarist, and he
must stick to his art, such as it is, for otherwise he were
Epimetheus if he changed his mind. In this quaint glancing
mixture of the serious and the sarcastic, it is possible to guess
a good deal, but guessing, as I have ventured to announce
pretty prominently, is not the object of this book.</p>

<p class='c001'>To Rhetoric, as distinguished from literary criticism proper,
Lucian’s chief (indeed his only considerable and substantive)
contribution is the so-called “Master of the Orators,”<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c008'><sup>[214]</sup></a>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Works touching Rhetoric.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to which may be added a μελέτη or declamation
on one of the stock subjects (a case of
tyrannicide) and some parts of the “Twice Accused Man.”<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c008'><sup>[215]</sup></a>
This last is a curious <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pot-pourri</i></span> of satire on the different schools
of philosophy, on the methods of the law courts, and on forensic
eloquence. Rhetoric herself appears, besides an impersonation
of Dialogue, both in the character of public prosecutors
against “the Syrian.” Rhetoric states that he has deserted
her for Dialogue, Dialogue that he has disgraced and shamed
him by burlesque. Now Lucian, it is hardly necessary to say,
was a Syrian, and had been a professional teacher of Rhetoric
himself. The piece is chiefly parody, especially in the two
speeches just mentioned, where Lucian displays that faculty of
causing his characters to make themselves ridiculous, in which
he has had no rival (except the authors of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Satire Menippée</cite></span>
and Butler), to admiration. The reasons given by the “Syrian”
for deserting Rhetoric are also very funny.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the whole has only a partial connection with literature,
and is even more concerned with the degradation of the
Rhetorical profession than with Rhetoric herself. Incidentally,
however, it shows the strong attraction of that subject, warped
and mismanaged as it was, for persons with the literary interest
in them. If Rhetoric could have seen herself as she ought to be—even
as she is in Longinus—it is pretty certain that Lucian
would not have said the hard things against her which here
appear.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>The “Master of the Rhetors” or Orators is in the common
form of rhetorical treatises, the form of the Περὶ Ὕψους itself,
that of an address to a young friend. This young friend had
asked how a man might become a rhetor and a sophist, a position
and title which he thought the noblest of all. Lucian
has not the least objection to tell him, so let him listen. He
shall climb the steep easily and rest on the heights, while
others are tumbling down and cracking their crowns. Let
there be no doubt about this. Poetry is a more difficult thing
than rhetoric, and did not Hesiod master it by just plucking
a few leaves from Helicon? Did not a merchant show Alexander
a short cut from Persia to Egypt, only the unbelieving
Macedonian would not listen? Lucian will be that merchant.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are two ways to Rhetoric (see Cebes on another matter).
One (to cut short the abundant and agreeable “chaff” of
which, here as elsewhere, Lucian is so prodigal) is the long,
troublesome, and ungrateful imitation of the mighty men of
antiquity, of Plato and Demosthenes and the rest. The other,
dealt with more copiously and more ironically still, is quite
different. You learn a few fashionable catchwords for ordinary
use, and some precious archaisms for occasional ornament;
you must get rid of all bashfulness, dress yourself very well,
cultivate the vices which happen to be in vogue, or at any
rate pretend to them, and keep a good deal of company with
women and servants, for both are babblesome and seldom at a
loss. There is nothing hard in this and other precepts; and if
you observe them, you will soon become a famous orator. Very
good fun all of it, and very shrewd “criticism of life,” no doubt,
but only distantly connected with criticism of literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet it requires no hazardous conjecture to discern a very
considerable literary critic in Lucian, and to discover the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His critical limitations.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
reason why that critic did not come out in himself
or in his contemporaries, unless we are to rank the
lonely and magnificent personality of Longinus among these.
There was interesting literature in Lucian’s time—it is enough
to mention the name of Apuleius to establish that proposition—but
hardly any of it was exactly great, and the best of it
was marred, either by the negative tendency which is one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>side of despair of greatness, or else by the hectic colours of
decadence, or by the dubious struggles of new tendencies not
yet quite ready to be born. Lucian himself (at any rate, after
that youth of which we know so little) inclined, it is not necessary
to say, to the negative side. He was distinctly deficient
in enthusiasm (with which, perhaps, the critical artist can dispense
as little as the creative), and had small feeling for poetry.
His admiration for the great Attic prose writers, and its result
in his own delightful style, are obvious enough; while the justice,
if also the rigour, of his onslaughts on the characteristics most
opposed to theirs, the characteristics of florid, “conceited,”
neologistic prose and verse, cannot be denied. But the unsatisfactory
negation of his religious and philosophical criticism
extends also to his literary attitude. “Cannot you,” one feels
inclined to say, “find something to say <em>for</em> as well as against
luxuriance of fancy, wealth of colour, delicate suggestiveness
of thought and phrase?” Cannot you, like Longinus, admit
that Nature meant men to think and write magnificently of
the magnificent? He could not, or he would not: his very
interest in literature as literature seems to have been lukewarm.
And so the greatest writer of all the later Greeks, a
writer great enough to rank with all but the very greatest of
the earlier, gives us very little but carping criticism of literature,
and not much even of that.</p>

<p class='c001'>It does not fall within the plan of this work to examine at
any length the recently much-debated question whether the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Longinus: the difficulties raised.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
treatise Περὶ Ὕψους is, as after its first publication
by Robortello in 1554 it was for nearly three centuries
unquestioningly taken to be, the work of the rhetorician
Longinus, who was Queen Zenobia’s Prime Minister, and
was put to death by Aurelian. It has been the mania of the
nineteenth century to prove that everybody’s work was written
by somebody else, and it will not be the most useless task of
the twentieth to betake itself to more profitable inquiries.
References which will enable any one who cares to investigate
the matter are given in a note.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c008'><sup>[216]</sup></a> Here it may be sufficient to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>say two things. The first is, that these questions appertain for
settlement, less to the technical expert than to the intelligent
<i>judex</i>, the half-juryman, half-judge, who is generally acquainted
with the rules of logic and the laws of evidence. The second is,
that the verdict of the majority of such <i>judices</i> on this particular
question is, until some entirely new documents turn up, likely
to be couched in something like the following form:—</p>

<p class='c001'>1. The positive evidence for the authorship of Longinus is
very weak, consisting in MS. attributions, the oldest of which<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c008'><sup>[217]</sup></a>
is irresolute in form, while it certainly does not date earlier
than the tenth century.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. There is absolutely no <i>evidence</i> against the authorship of
Longinus, only a set of presumptions, most of which are sheer
opinion, and carry no weight except as such. Moreover, no
plausible competitor has even been hinted at. I hope it is not
illiberal to say that the suggestion of Plutarch, which was made
by Vaucher, and has met with some favour, carries with it
irresistible evidence that the persons who make it know little
about criticism. No two things could possibly be more different
than the amiable ethical knack of the author of the <cite>Moralia</cite>,
and the intense literary gift of the author of the Περὶ Ὕψους.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another of the “Academic questions” connected with the
book, however, is of more literary importance, and that is its
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Sublimity</i>.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
proper designation in the modern languages. There
has been a consensus of the best authorities of late
years, even though they may not agree on other points, that
“The Sublime” is a far from happy translation of ὕψος. Not
only has “Sublime” in the modern languages, and especially in
English, a signification too much specialised, but the specialisation
is partly in the wrong direction. No one, for instance, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>uses English correctly, however great his enthusiasm for the
magnificent Sapphic ode which Longinus has had the well-deserved
good fortune to preserve to us, would call it exactly
sublime,<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c008'><sup>[218]</sup></a> there being, in the English connotation of that word,
an element of calmness, or at any rate (for a storm may be
sublime) of mastery, which is absent here. And so in other
cases; “Sublime” being more especially unfortunate in bringing
out (what no doubt remains to some extent in any case)
the inadequateness and tautology of the attempts to define
the <em>sources</em> of ὕψος. Hall, the seventeenth-century translator,
avoided these difficulties by a simple rendering, “the height of
eloquence,” which is more than literally exact, though it is
neither elegant nor handy. Nor is there perhaps any single
word that is not open to almost as many objections as Sublime
itself. So that (and again this is the common conclusion) it
is well to keep it, with a very careful preliminary explanation
that the Longinian Sublime is not sublimity in its narrower
sense, but all that quality, or combination of qualities, which
creates <em>enthusiasm</em> in literature, all that gives <em>consummateness</em>
to it, all that deserves the highest critical encomium either in
prose or poetry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Few persons, however, whom the gods have made critical
will care to spend much time <em>in limine</em> over the authorship,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Quality and contents of the treatise.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the date,<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c008'><sup>[219]</sup></a> the title, and the other beggarly elements
in respect to this astonishing treatise. Incomplete
as it is—and its incompleteness is as evident as that
of the <cite>Poetics</cite>, and probably not much less substantial—difficult as
are some of its terms, deprived as we are in some cases of the power
of appreciating its citations fully, through our ignorance of their
context, puzzled as we may even be now and then by that radical
difference in taste and view-point, that “great gulf fixed,” which
sometimes, though only sometimes, does interpose itself between
modern and ancient,—no student of criticism, hardly one would
think any fairly educated and intelligent man, can read a dozen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>lines of the book without finding himself in a new world, as
he compares it with even the best of his earlier critical masters.
He is in the presence of a man who has accidentally far
greater advantages of field than Aristotle, essentially far more
powerful genius, and an intenser appreciation of literature, than
Dionysius or Quintilian. And probably the first thought—not
of the student, who will be prepared for it, but of the fairly
educated man who knows something of Pope and Boileau and
the rest of them—will be, “How on earth did this book come to
be quoted as an authority by a school like that of the ‘classical’
critics of the seventeenth-eighteenth century, whose every principle
almost, whose general opinions certainly, it seems to have
been designedly written to crush, conclude, and quell?” Of
this more hereafter. Let us begin, as in former important
cases, by a short abstract of the actual contents of the book.</p>

<p class='c001'>The author commences by addressing a young friend or pupil,
a certain Postumius (Terentianus or Florentianus?), on the
inefficiency of the Treatise on the Sublime by a certain
Cæcilius.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c008'><sup>[220]</sup></a> In endeavouring to provide something more satisfactory,
especially as to the sources of Sublimity, he premises
little more in the shape of definition than that it is “a
certain consummateness and eminence” of words, completing
this with the remark (the first epoch-making one of the
treatise) that the effect of such things is “not persuasion but
transport,”<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c008'><sup>[221]</sup></a> not the result of skill, pains, and arrangement,
but something which, “opportunely out-flung,”<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c008'><sup>[222]</sup></a> carries everything
before it. But can it be taught? Is it not innate?
The doubt implies a fallacy. Nature is necessary, but it must
be guided and helped by art. Then comes a gap, a specially
annoying one, since the farther shore lands us in the midst of
an unfavourable criticism of a passage supposed to come from
the lost <cite>Orithyia</cite> of Æschylus, which is succeeded by, or grouped
with, other specimens of the false sublime, bombast, tumidity, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>the <i>parenthurson</i>.<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c008'><sup>[223]</sup></a> Next we pass to “frigidity,” a term which
Longinus uses with a slightly different connotation from Aristotle’s,
applying it chiefly to what he thinks undue flings and
quips and conceits. These particular strictures are, in Chapter
V., generalised off into a brief but admirable censure of the
quest for mere novelty, of that “horror of the obvious” which
bad taste at all times has taken for a virtue. To cure this and
other faults, there is nothing for it but to make for the true
Sublime, hard as it may be. For (again a memorable and
epoch-making saying) “the judgment of words is the latest
begotten fruit of many an attempt.”<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c008'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The first canon of sublimity is not unlike the famous <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Quod
Semper</i></span>, &amp;c. If a thing does not transport <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>at all</i></span>, it is certainly
not Sublime. If its transporting power fails with repetition,
with submission to different but still competent judges, it is not
sublime. When men different in habits, lives, aims, ages,
speech, agree about it, then no mistake is possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sources of Sublimity are next defined as five in number:
Command of strong and manly thought; Vehement and enthusiastic
passion—these are congenital; Skilfulness with Figures;
Nobility of phrase; Dignified and elevated <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ordonnance</i></span>.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c008'><sup>[225]</sup></a> These,
after a rebuke of some length to Cæcilius for omitting Passion,
he proceeds to discuss seriatim. The ἁδρεπήβολον, which he
now calls “great-naturedness,”<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c008'><sup>[226]</sup></a> holds the first place in value
as in order, and examples of it, and of the failure to reach it,
are given from many writers, Homer and “the Legislator of the
Jews” being specially praised. This laudation leads to one of
the best known and most interesting passages of the whole
book, a short criticism and comparison of the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the
<cite>Odyssey</cite>, whereon, as on other things in this abstract, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>hereafter. The interest certainly does not sink with the quotation
from Sappho, whether we agree or not (again <i>vide post</i>)
that the source of its charm is “the selection and composition
of her details.” Other typical passages are then cited and
criticised.</p>

<p class='c001'>We next come to Amplification,—almost the first evidence
in the treatise, and not a fatal one, of the numbing power of
“Figures.” Longinus takes occasion by it for many illuminative
animadversions, not merely on Homer, but on Plato,
Herodotus, Demosthenes, and Thucydides, whom (it is very
satisfactory to observe) he includes among those who have
“sublimity.” This handling of Figures, professedly eclectic, is
fertile in such animadversions in regard to others besides
Amplification—Hyperbata, Polyptota, Antimetathesis, and
others still—with especial attention to Periphrasis, to his
praise of which the eighteenth century perhaps attended without
due attention to his cautions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then comes another of the flashes of light. Dismissing the
figures, he turns to diction in itself, and has a wonderful passage
on it, culminating in the dictum, “For beautiful words are in
deed and in fact the very light of the spirit,”<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c008'><sup>[227]</sup></a>—the Declaration
of Independence and the “Let there be light” at once of
Literary Criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here the Enemy seems to have thought that he was getting
too good, for another and greater gap occurs, and when we are
allowed to read again, we are back among the Figures and dealing
with Metaphor—the criticism of examples, however, being
still illuminative. It leads him, moreover, to another of his
nugget-grounds, the discussion on “Faultlessness,” which introduces
some especially valuable parallels—Apollonius and
Homer, Bacchylides and Pindar, Ion and Sophocles, Hyperides
and Demosthenes, Lysias and Plato. Then we pass to the
figure Hyperbole after a gap, and then to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ordonnance</i></span> and
arrangement, with a passage, valuable but, like all similar
passages in the ancient critics, difficult, on rhythm. After
this a section on μικρότης—“littleness,” “triviality”—leads
abruptly to the close, which is not the close, and which, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>some extremely interesting remarks on the ethical and other
conditions of the time, ends with an unfulfilled promise of
treating the subject of the Passions. The loss of this is
perhaps more to be regretted than the loss of any other single
tractate of the kind in antiquity. It might have been, and
possibly was, only a freshening up of the usual rhetorical
commonplaces about the “colours of good and evil,” and the
probable disposition of the hearer or reader. But it might
also, and from Longinus’s handling of the other stock subject
of the Figures it is much more likely to, have been something
mainly, if not wholly, new: in fact, something that to this day
we have not got—an analysis of the direct appeals of literature
to the primary emotions of the soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>In considering this inestimable book, it is hardly possible to
exaggerate the importance of these early words of it to which
attention has been drawn above. The yoke of “persuasion”
has at last been broken from the neck of the critic. He does
not consider literature as something which will help a man
to carry an assembly with him, to persuade a jury, to gain a
declamation prize. He does indeed still mention the listener
rather than the reader; but that is partly tradition, partly a
consequence of the still existing prevalence of recitation or
reading aloud. Further, it is sufficiently evident that the critic
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Preliminary Retrospect.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
has come to regard literature as a whole, and is not
distracted by supposed requirements of “invention”
on the part of the poet, of “persuasion” on the part of the
orator, and so forth. He looks at the true and only test of
literary greatness—the “transport,” the absorption of the
reader. And he sees as no one, so far as we know, saw before
him (except Dionysius for a moment and “in a glass darkly”),
as Dante was the only man after him to see for a millennium
and much more, that the beautiful words, the “mots
rayonnants,” are at least a main means whereby this effect is
produced. Instead of style and its criticism being dismissed,
or admitted at best with impatience as something φορτικόν,
we have that gravest and truest judgment of the latter as
the latest-born offspring of many a painful endeavour. Far is
it indeed from him to stick to the word only: his remarks on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>novelty, his peroration (not intended as such, but so coming
to us), and many other things, are proof of that. But in the
main his criticism is of the pure æsthetic kind, and of the best
of that kind. It will not delay us too much to examine it a
little more in detail.</p>

<p class='c001'>The opening passage as to Cæcilius, though it has tempted
some into perilous hypothetic reconstructions of that critic’s
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Detailed Criticism: The opening.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
possible teaching, really comes to little more than
this—that Longinus, like most of us, was not exactly
satisfied with another man’s handling of his favourite
subject. And, curiously enough, the only specific fault that
he here finds—namely, that his predecessor, while illustrating
the nature of the Sublime amply, neglected to discuss the means
of reaching it—rather recoils on himself. For there can be little
doubt that the weakest part of the Περὶ Ὕψους is its discussion
of “sources.” But the great phrase, already more than once
referred to, as to transport or ecstasy, not persuasion, lifts us
at once—itself transports us—into a region entirely different
from that of all preceding Rhetorics, without at the same time
giving any reason to fear loss of touch with the common ground
and common-sense. For nothing can be saner than the handling,
in the second chapter, of that <i>aporia</i> concerning nature and
art, genius and painstaking, which has not infrequently been
the cause of anything but sane writing.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the gap, however, we come to one of the passages
recently glanced at, and mentioned or to be mentioned so
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The stricture on the</i> Orithyia.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
often elsewhere, which warn us as to difference of
view. The passage, supposed to be, as we said,
Æschylean and from the <cite>Orithyia</cite>, is no doubt at
rather more than “concert-pitch.” It is Marlowe rather than
Shakespeare; yet Shakespeare himself has come near to it in
<cite>Lear</cite> and elsewhere, and one line at least—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>μίαν παρείρας πλεκτάνην χειμάρῥοον—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>is a really splendid piece of metre and phrase, worthy, high-pitched
as it is, of the author of the <cite>Oresteia</cite> and the <cite>Prometheus</cite> at his
very best. So, too, the much-enduring Gorgias would hardly have
received very severe reprehension from any but the extremest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>precisians of modern criticism, at its most starched time, for calling
vultures “living tombs.” But the horror of the Greeks on
the one hand for anything extravagant, bizarre, out of measure,
on the other for the slightest approach in serious work to the
unbecoming, the unpleasantly suggestive, makes Longinus here
a very little prudish. And his general remarks are excellent,
especially in reference to τὸ παρένθυρσον, which I have ventured
to interpret, not quite in accordance with the general rendering,
“the poking in of the thyrsus at the wrong time,” the affectation
of Bacchanalian fury where no fury need be.</p>

<p class='c001'>But we still have the same warning in the chapter on
Frigidity, coupled with another—that, perhaps, as sometimes
happens, Longinus' sense of humour was not quite
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Frigidity.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
equal to his sense of sublimity, and  yet another—that
the historic sense, so late developed everywhere, was,
perhaps, not very strong in him. We, at least, should give
Timæus the benefit of a doubt, as to the presence of a certain
not inexcusable irony in the comparison (in which, for instance,
neither Swift nor Carlyle would have hesitated to indulge) of
the times taken by Alexander to conquer Asia and by Isocrates
to write the <cite>Panegyric</cite>. On the other hand, he seems to forget
the date of Timæus when he finds the μικροχαρές, the paltrily
funny, in the historian’s connection of the Athenian Hermocopidæ
and their punishment by Hermocrates, the son of
Hermon. There is no reason why Timæus should not have
been quite serious, though in the third century after Christ,
and even in the first, the allusion might seem either a tasteless
freethinking jest or a silly piece of superstition.</p>

<p class='c001'>But by far the most interesting thing in this context
is Longinus' irreconcilable objection to a fanciful metaphor
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The “maidens in the eyes.”</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which, as it happens most oddly, was, with a very
slight variation, an equal pet of the Greeks of the
great age and of our own Elizabethans. Every
reader of the latter knows the phrase, “to look babies in the
eyes” of the beloved—that is to say, to keep the face so close
to hers that the little reflections of the gazer in the pupils of
her eyes are discernible. The Greek term for these little
images, and the pupils that mirrored them, was slightly different—it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>was κόραι, maidens. And as, from the famous quarrel scene
in Homer downwards, the eyes were always, in Greek literature,
the seat of modesty or of impudence, the combination suggested,
not merely to Timæus but even to Xenophon, a play of words,
“more modest than the maidens in their eyes,” or conversely,
as where Timæus, speaking of the lawless lust of Agathocles,
says that he must have had “harlots” (πόρνας), not “maidens”
(κόρας), in his eyes. And Longinus is even more angry or sad
with Xenophon than with Timæus, as expecting more propriety
from him.</p>

<p class='c001'>But whether we agree with him in detail or not, the inestimable
passage, on the mere quest and craze for novelty, which
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The canon <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quod semper.”</span></i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
follows, more than reconciles us, as well as the other
great saying in cap. vi. as to the “late-born”
character of the judgment of style, and that in the
next as to the canon of Sublimity being the effect produced
unaltered in altered circumstances and cases. When we read
these things we feel that literary criticism is at last fully
constituted,—that it wants nothing more save greater variety,
quantity, and continuance of literary creation, upon which to
exercise itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>No nervous check or chill need be caused by the tolerably
certain fact that more than one hole may be picked in the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The sources of sublimity.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
subsequent classification of the sources<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c008'><sup>[228]</sup></a> of ὕψος.
These attempts at an over-methodical classification
(it has been said before) are always full of snares and pitfalls
to the critic. Especially do they tempt him to the sin of arguing
in a circle. It cannot be denied that in every one of the
five divisions (except, perhaps, the valuable vindication of the
quality of Passion) there is some treacherous word or other,
which is a mere synonym of “sublime.” Thus in the first we
have ἁδρεπήβολον, mastery of the ἅδρον, a curious word, the
nearest equivalent of which in English is, perhaps, “stout” or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“full-bodied,” as we apply these terms to wine; in the fourth
γενναία, “noble,” which is only “sublime” in disguise; and in
the fifth εν δε φαει και ολεσσον, of which much the same may
be said.</p>

<p class='c001'>Any suggestion, however, of paralogism which might arise
from this and be confirmed by the curious introduction in the
third of the Figures, as if they were machines for automatic sublime-coining,
must be dispelled by the remarks on Passion of
the right kind as tending to sublimity, and by the special stress
laid on the primary necessity of μεγαλοφροσύνη, whereof ὕψος
itself is the mere ἀπήχημα or echo. Unfortunately here, as
so often, the gap comes just in the most important place.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the cloud lifts, however, we find ourselves in one of
the most interesting passages of the whole, the selection of
“sublime” passages from Homer. A little superfluous matter
about Homer’s “impiety” (the old, the respectable, Platonic mistake)
occurs; but it matters not, especially in face of the two
praises of the “Let there be light” of the Jewish legislator,
“no chance comer,” and of the great ἐν δὲ φάει καὶ ὄλεσσον of
Ajax, the mere juxtaposition of which once more shows what a
critic we have got in our hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not quite such a great one perhaps have we—yet one in the
circumstances equally fascinating—in the contrasted remarks
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Longinus on Homer.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
on the <cite>Odyssey</cite>. Longinus is not himself impious;
he is no Separatist (he is indeed far too good a critic
to be that). But he will have the Romance of Ulysses to
be “old age, though the old age of Homer.” “When a great
nature is a little gone under, philomythia is characteristic of its
decline.”<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c008'><sup>[229]</sup></a> Evidently, he thinks, the <cite>Odyssey</cite> was Homer’s second
subject, not his first. He is “a setting sun as mighty as ever,
but less intense”: he is more unequal: he takes to the fabulous
and the incredible. The Wine of Circe, the foodless voyage of
Ulysses, the killing of the suitors—nay, the very attention paid
to Character and Manners—tell the tale of decadence.</p>

<p class='c001'>He is wrong, undoubtedly wrong—we may swear it boldly
by those who fell in Lyonnesse, and in the palace of Atli, and
under the echoes of the horn of Roland. The <cite>Odyssey</cite> is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>less than the <cite>Iliad</cite>; it is different. But we can hardly quarrel
with him for being wrong, because his error is so instructive, so
interesting. We see in it first (even side by side with not a
little innovation) that clinging to the great doctrines of old, to
the skirts of Aristotle and of Plato, which is so often found in
noble minds and so seldom in base ones. And we see, moreover,
that far as he had advanced—near as he was to an actual peep
over the verge of the old world and into the new—he was still
a Greek himself at heart, with the foibles and limitations—no
despicable foibles and limitations—of the race. Here is the
instinctive unreasoning terror of the unknown Romance; the
dislike of the vague and the fabulous; even that curious craze
about Character being in some way inferior to Action, which we
have seen before. By the time of Longinus—if he lived in the
third century certainly, if he lived in the first probably—the
romance did exist. But it was looked upon askance; it had no
regular literary rank; and a sort of resentment was apparently
felt at its daring to claim equality with the epic. Now the
<i>Odyssey</i> is the first, and not far from the greatest, of romances.
It has the Romantic Unity in the endurance and triumph of
its hero. It has the Romantic Passion in the episodes
of Circe and Calypso and others: above all, it has the great
Romantic breadth, the free sweep of scene and subject, the
variety, the contrast of fact and fancy, the sparkle and hurry
and throb. But these things, to men trained in the admiration
of the <em>other</em> Unity, the <em>other</em> Passion, the more formal, regulated,
limited, measured detail and incident of the usual tragedy and
the usual epic—were at best unfamiliar innovations, and at
worst horrible and daring impieties. Longinus will not go this
length: he cannot help seeing the beauty of the <cite>Odyssey</cite>. But
he must reconcile his principles to his feelings by inventing a
theory of decadence, for which, to speak frankly, there is no
critical justification at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>One may almost equally disagree with the <em>special</em> criticism
which serves as setting to the great jewel among the quotations
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On Sappho.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of the treatise, the so-called “Ode to Anactoria.”
The charm of this wonderful piece consists, according
to Longinus, in the skill with which Sappho chooses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the accompanying emotions of “erotic mania.”<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c008'><sup>[230]</sup></a> To which
one may answer, “Hardly so,” but in the skill with which
she expresses those emotions which she selects, and in the
wonderful adaptation of the metre to the expression, in the
mastery of the picture of the most favoured lover, drawing
close and closer to the beloved to catch the sweet speech,<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c008'><sup>[231]</sup></a> and
the laughter full of desire. In saying this we should have
the support of the Longinus of other parts of the treatise
against the Longinus of this. Yet here, too, he is illuminative;
here, too, the “noble error” of the Aristotelian conception of
poetry distinguishes and acquits him.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the remarks on αὔξησις, “amplification,” as it is traditionally
but by no means satisfactorily rendered, another phase
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Amplification.</i>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of the critical disease of antiquity (which is no doubt
balanced by other diseases in the modern critical
body) may be thought to appear. Both in the definition of
this figure and in the description of its method we may, not
too suspiciously, detect evidences of that excessive technicality
which gave to Rhetoric itself the exclusive title of <i>techne</i>.
<i>Auxesis</i>, it seems, comes in when the business, or the point
at issue, admits at its various stages of divers fresh starts and
rests, of one great phrase being wheeled upon the stage after
another, continually introduced in regular ascent.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c008'><sup>[232]</sup></a> This, it
seems, can be done either by means of τοπηγορία, “handling
of <i>topoi</i> or commonplaces,” or by δείνωσις, which may perhaps
be best rendered <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tour de force</i></span>, or by cunning successive disposition
(ἐποικονομία) of facts or feelings. For, says he, there
are ten thousand kinds of <i>auxesis</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first description of the method will recall to all comparative
students of literature the manner of Burke, though
it is not exactly identical with that manner; but the instances
of means, besides being admittedly inadequate, savour, with
their technicalities of terminology, much too strongly of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>cut-and-dried manual. The third article, on a reasonable interpretation
of ἐποικονομία, really includes all that need be said.
But one sees here, as later, that even Longinus had not quite
outgrown the notion that the teacher of Rhetoric was bound
to present his student with a sort of hand-list of “tips” and
dodges—with the kind of Cabbala wherewith the old-fashioned
crammer used to supply his pupils for inscription on wristband
or finger-nail. Yet he hastens to give a sign of grace by avowing
his dissatisfaction with the usual Rhetorical view, and by
distinguishing <i>auxesis</i> and the Sublime itself, in a manner
which brings the former still nearer to Burke’s “winding into
a subject like a serpent,” and which might have been more
edifying still if one of the usual gaps did not occur. Part, at
least, of the lost matter must have been occupied with a contrast
or comparison between the methods of Plato and Demosthenes,
the end of which we have, and which passes into one
between Demosthenes and Cicero. “If we Greeks may be
allowed to have an opinion,” says Longinus, with demure
humility, “Demosthenes shall be compared to a flash of thunder
and lightning, Cicero to an ordinary terrestrial conflagration,”
which is very handsome to Cicero.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he returns to Plato, and rightly insists that much of
his splendour is derived from imitation, or at least from emulation,
of that very Homer whom he so often attacks. The great
writers of the past are to be constantly before us, and we are
not to be deterred from “letting ourselves go” by any mistaken
sense of inferiority, or any dread of posterity’s verdict.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then comes a digression of extreme importance on the subject
of φαντασίαι or εἰδωλοποιΐαι—“images.” One of the points in
which a history of the kind here attempted may
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Images.</i>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
prove to be of most service, lies in the opportunity
it affords of keeping the changes of certain terms, commonly
used in criticism, more clearly before the mind than has always
been done. And of these, none requires more care than
“Images” and “Imagination.” At the first reading, the mere
use of such a word as φαντασίαι may seem to make all over-scrupulousness
unnecessary, though if we remember that even
Fancy is not quite Imagination, the danger may be lessened.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>At any rate, it is nearly certain that no ancient writer,<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c008'><sup>[233]</sup></a> and
no modern critic before a very recent period (Shakespeare
uses it rightly, but then he was Shakespeare and not a critic),
attached our full sense to the term. To Aristotle φαντασία
is merely αἴσθησις ἀσθενὴς, a “weakened sensation,” a copy
furnished by memory from sensation itself. Even animals
have it. No idea of Invention seems to have mingled with
it, or only of such invention as the artist’s is when he faithfully
represents natural objects. Of the Imagination, which is
in our minds when we call Shelley an imaginative poet, and
Pope not one, Sir Edward Burne Jones an imaginative painter,
and any contemporary whom it may be least invidious to
name not one, there does not seem to have been a trace even
in the enthusiastic mind of Longinus, though he expressly
includes Enthusiasm—nay, Passion—in his notion of it. You
think you see what you say, and you make your hearers see
it. Good; but Crabbe does that constantly, and one would
hardly, save in the rarest cases, call Crabbe imaginative. In
short, φαντασίαι here are vivid illustrations drawn from
nature—Orestes’ hallucination of the Eumenides, Euripides’
picture of Phaethon, that in the <i>Seven</i> of the slaying of
the bull over the black-bound shield, and many others. No
doubt he glances at the fabulous and incredible, the actually
“imagined”; but he seems, as in the case of the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, to be
a little doubtful of these even in poetry, while in oratory he
bars them altogether. You must at one and the same time
reason and illustrate—again the very method of Burke.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the rest of the illustrations of the use of Figures—for the
central part of the treatise expressly disclaims being a formal
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Figures.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
discussion of these idols—the positive literary criticisms
scattered in them—the actual “reviewing”—will
give most of the interest. The great Oath of Demosthenes,
“By those who fell at Marathon!” with its possible suggestion
by a passage of Eupolis, supplies a whole chapter and part of
another. And now we find the curious expression (showing how
even Longinus was juggled by terms) that Figures “fight on
the side of the Sublime, and in turn draw a wonderful reinforcement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>from it,” wherein a mighty if vague reality like the
Sublime, and mere shadows (though neatly cut-out shadows)
like the Figures, are most quaintly yoked together.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though still harassed by gaps, we find plenty of good pasture
in the remarks, the handling of Periphrasis being especially
attractive. For the eighteenth century—the time which honoured
Longinus most in theory, and went against him most in
practice—undoubtedly took part of his advice as to this figure.
It had no doubt that Periphrasis contributed to the Sublime,
was ὑψηλοποιόν: unluckily it paid less attention to his
subsequent caution, that it is a risky affair, and that it smells
of triviality.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c008'><sup>[234]</sup></a> In fact, it is extremely noticeable that in the
examples of Periphrasis which he praises we should hardly
apply that name to it, but should call it “Allusion” or “Metaphor,”
while the examples that he condemns are actually of
the character of Armstrong’s “gelid cistern” and Delille’s
“game which Palamede invented.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At no time perhaps has the tricksy, if not (as one is almost
driven to suspect) deliberately malignant, mutilator played such
a trick as in abstracting four leaves from the MS. between
caps. xxx. and xxxi. Here Longinus has begun to speak
of diction generally; here he has made that admirable descant
on “beautiful words” which, though almost all the book deserves
to be written in letters of gold, would tempt one to indulge
here in precious stones, so as to mimic, in jacinth and
sapphire and chrysoprase, the effect which it celebrates. When
we are permitted another glimpse we are back in particular
criticism, interesting but less valuable save indirectly, and in
criticisms, too, of Cæcilius, criticisms which we could do without.
No great good can ever come of inquiries, at least general
inquiries, into the permissible number and the permissible
strength of Metaphors. Once more we may fall back on the
Master, though perhaps rather in opposition to some of the
Master’s dicta in this very field. “As the intelligent man
shall decide” is the decision here, and the intelligent man will
never decide till the case is before him. One bad metaphor is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>too much: twenty good ones are not too many. Nor is “the
multitudinous seas incarnadine” an “excess,” though no doubt
there have been bad critics who thought so.</p>

<p class='c001'>Longinus himself, though he had not had the happiness to
read <cite>Macbeth</cite>, was clearly not far out of agreement with the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Faultlessness.</i>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
concluding sentiment of the last paragraph, and he
makes this certain by the disquisition on Faultlessness
which follows. As a general question this is probably, for
the present time at any rate, past argument, not so much because
the possibility of a “faultless” great poem is denied, as because
under the leaden rule of the best modern criticism—leaden
not from dulness but from adaptability—few things are recognised
as “faults” <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in se</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>.  A pun may be a gross fault
in one place and a grace beyond the reach of art in another:
an aposiopesis may be either a proof of clumsy inequality to
the situation or a stroke of genius. But the declaration of
Longinus that he is not on the side of Faultlessness<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c008'><sup>[235]</sup></a> is of
infinitely greater importance than any such declaration from
an equally great critic (“Where is he? Show him to me,” as
Rabelais would say) could possess to-day. The general Greek
theory undoubtedly did make for excessive severity to faultfulness,
just as our general theory makes perhaps for undue
leniency to it. That Longinus could withstand this tendency—could
point out the faults of the faultless—was a very great
thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>As always, too, his individual remarks frequently give us, not
merely the satisfaction of agreement, but that of piquant difference
or curiosity. We may agree with him about Bacchylides
and Pindar—though, by the way, the man who had the taste and
the courage to admire a girl as χλωραύχενα—as possessing that
yellow ivory tint of skin which lights so magnificently<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c008'><sup>[236]</sup></a>—was
certainly one to dare to challenge convention with what its
lilies-and-roses standard must have thought a “fault.” But we
cannot help astonishment at being told that both Pindar and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Sophocles “often have their light quenched without any obvious
reason, and stumble in the most unfortunate manner.”<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c008'><sup>[237]</sup></a> For
those of us who are less, as well as those who are more,
enthusiastic about Sophocles would probably agree in asking,
“Where does he ‘go out in snuff,’ where does he ‘fall prostrate’
in this fashion?” Surely all the faults cannot be in the lost
plays! We want a rather fuller text of Hyperides than we
possess to enable us quite to appreciate the justice of the comparison
of him with Demosthenes, but that justice is striking
even on what we have. On the other hand, we are rather
thrown out by the contrast of Plato and Lysias—it may be
owing to the same cause. Even if the comparison were one of
style only, we should think it odd to make one between Burke
and Berkeley, though the <i>Sublime and Beautiful</i> would help us
a little here.</p>

<p class='c001'>But all this is a digression,<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c008'><sup>[238]</sup></a> and the author seems to have
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Hyperboles.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
returned to his Metaphors (in a gap where the demon has interfered
with less malice than usual), and to Hyperboles,
under the head of which we get a useful touch
of contempt for Isocrates.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c008'><sup>[239]</sup></a> We are in deeper and more living
waters when we come to the handling, alas! too brief (though
nothing seems here to be lost), of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ordonnance</i></span>, “composition,”
selection and arrangement of words. Here is yet another of
those great law-making phrases which are the charter of a new
criticism. “Harmony is to men not only physically connected
with persuasion and pleasure, but a wonderful instrument of
magniloquence and passion.” It may be difficult for us, with
our very slight knowledge (it would, perhaps, be wiser to say
almost absolute ignorance) of Greek pronunciation, to appreciate
his illustrations here in detail. But we can appreciate the
principle of them exactly, and apply that principle,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Harmony.</i>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in any language of which we do know the
pronunciation, with perfect ease and the completest success.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>The silly critics (they exist at the present day) who pooh-pooh,
as niceties and fiddle-faddle, the order of words, the
application of rhythmical tests to prose, and the like, are
answered here beforehand with convincing force by a critic
whom no one can possibly charge with preferring sound to
sense.</p>

<p class='c001'>This refers to prose, but the following chapter carries out the
same principle as to poetry with equal acuteness. Longinus,
great as his name is, probably is but little in the hands of those
who object (sometimes almost with foam at the mouth) to the
practice of analysing the mere harmonic effect of poetry. But
it is pleasant to think of these passages when one reads the outcries,
nor is the pleasantness rendered less pleasant by the
subsequent cautions against that over-rhythmical fashion of
writing which falls to the level of mere dance-music.</p>

<p class='c001'>The caution against over-conciseness and over-prolixity is
rather more of a matter of course, and the strictures on the
μικρότης, occasionally to be found in Herodotus, like some in
the earlier parts of the treatise, sometimes elude us, as is the
case with similar verbal criticisms even in languages with which
we are colloquially familiar.</p>

<p class='c001'>And then there is the curious Conclusion which, as we have
said, is no conclusion at all, as it would seem, and which yet has
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Conclusion.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
an unmistakable air of “peroration, with [much]
circumstance,” on the everlasting question, “Why is
the Sublime so rare in our time?” In that day, as in this, we
learn (the fact being, as in King Charles II.'s fish-experiment,
taken for granted), divers explanations, chiefly political,
were given for the fact. Democracy was a good nurse of greatness:
aristocracy was not. But Longinus did not agree. It
was money-getting and money-seeking, pleasure-loving and
pleasure-hunting, he thought. Plain living and high thinking
must be returned to if the Heights were to be once more scaled.
A noble conclusion, if perhaps only a generous fallacy. Had
Longinus had our illegitimate prerogative-<em>post</em>rogative of experience,
he would have known that the blowing of the wind
of the spirit admits of no such explanations as these. Ages
of Liberty and Ages of Servitude, Ages of Luxury and Ages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>of Simplicity, Ages of Faith and Ages of Freethought—all
give us the Sublime if the right man is there: none will give
it us if he is not. But our critic had not the full premisses
before him, and we could not expect the adequate conclusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet how great a book have we here! Of the partly otiose
disputes about its date and origin and authorship one or two
things are worth recalling, though for other purposes than those
of the disputants. Let it be remembered that it is not quoted,
or even referred to, by a single writer of antiquity.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c008'><sup>[240]</sup></a> There is
absolutely no evidence for it, except its own internal character,
before the date of its oldest manuscript, which is assigned to the
tenth century. Even if, assuming it to be the work of Longinus,
we suppose it to have been part of one of the works which <em>are</em>
ascribed to him (a possible assumption, see note), there is still
the absence of quotation, still the absence even of reference
to views so clearly formulated, so eloquently enforced, and in
some ways so remarkably different from those of the usual
Greek and Roman rhetorician. That the book can be of very
late date—much later, that is to say, than that of Longinus
himself—is almost impossible. One of its features, the lack
of any reference to even a single writer later than the first
century, has indeed been relied upon to prove that it is not
later itself than that date. This is inconclusive for that
purpose. But it makes every succeeding century less and
less probable, while the style, though in some respects peculiar,
is not in the least Byzantine.</p>

<p class='c001'>This detachment from any particular age—nay, more, this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vita
fallens</i></span>, this unrecognised existence of a book so remarkable—stands
in no merely fanciful relation to the characteristics of
the book itself. It abides alone in thought as well as in
history. That it is a genuine, if a late, production of the
classical or semi-classical age we cannot reasonably doubt, for
a multitude of reasons, small in themselves but strong in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>bundle,—its style, its diction, its limitations of material, and
even occasionally of literary view, its standards, all sorts of
little touches like the remark about Cicero, and so forth. Yet
it has, in the most important points, almost more difference from
than resemblance to the views of classical critics generally.
The much greater antiquity of Aristotle may be thought to
make comparison with him infructuous, if not unfair. But we
have seen already how far Longinus is from Dionysius, how
much further from Plutarch; and we shall see in the next Book
how far he is from Quintilian. Let us look where we will, to
critics by profession or to critics by chance, to the Alexandrians
as far as we know them, to the professional writers on Rhetoric,
to Aristophanes earlier and Lucian later, always we see Longinus
apart—among them by dispensation and time, but not
of them by tone, by tendency, by temper.</p>

<p class='c001'>For though he himself was almost certainly unconscious of it,
and might even have denied the fact with some warmth if it had
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Modernity of the treatise,</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>.
been put to him, Longinus has marked out grounds
of criticism very far from those of the ancient
period generally, further still from those which were
occupied by any critic (except Dante) of the Middle Ages and
the Classical revival, and close to, if not in all cases overlapping
the territory of, the modern Romantic criticism itself.
As we have seen, the ancient critic was wont either to neglect
the effect of a work of art altogether, and to judge it by its
supposed agreement with certain antecedent requirements, or
else, if effects were considered at all, to consider them from the
merely practical point of view, as in the supposed persuasive
effect of Rhetoric, or from the ethical, as in the purging, the
elevating, and so forth, assigned to Tragedy, and to Poetry
generally. Longinus has changed all this. It is the enjoyment,
the transport, the carrying away of the reader or auditor,
that, whether expressedly or not, is always at bottom the chief
consideration with him. He has not lowered the ethical standard
one jot, but he has silently refused to give it precedence of
the æsthetic; he is in no way for lawlessness, but he makes it
clear, again and again, that mere compliance with law, mere
fulfilment of the requirements of the stop-watch and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>hundredth-of-an-inch rule, will not suffice. Aristotle had been
forced, equally by his system and his sense, to admit that pleasure
was an end—perhaps the end—of art; but he blenches and
swerves from the consequences. Longinus faces them and
follows them out.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his attention to rhythm, especially of prose, Longinus is
much less unique, for this point (as we have seen and shall see)
was never neglected by the best ancient critics. But there is
again something particularly distinguishing in his attempt to
trace the sources of the literary pleasure in specimen passages.
The ancient tendency is, though not universally, yet too generally,
the other way, to select specimen passages merely as illustrations
of general rules.</p>

<p class='c001'>And this brings us to his greatest claim of all—that is to say,
his attitude towards his subject as a whole. Although he nowhere
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>or rather sempiternity.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
says as much in so many words, no one can
read his book with attention—above all, no one can
read it again and again critically—without seeing that to him
literature was not a schedule of forms, departments, kinds, with
candidates presenting themselves for the critic to admit them
to one or the other, on and during their good behaviour; but a
body of matter to be examined according to its fruits, according
to its provision of the literary pleasure. When it has been
examined it is still for the critic to explain and justify (according
to those unwritten laws which govern him) his decision
that this was good, this not so good, this bad,—to point out the
reasons of success and failure, to arrange the symptoms, classify
the methods, and so forth. Where Longinus fell short it was
almost always because ancient literature had not provided
him with enough material of certain kinds, not because he
ruled these kinds out <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>. Longinus was no Rymer. We
could submit even Shakespeare to him with very little fear, and
be perfectly certain that he would not, with Rapin, pronounce
Dantes Aligerus wanting in fire.<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c008'><sup>[241]</sup></a> Nay, with a sufficient body
of material to set before him, we could trust him with very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>much more dangerous cases than Shakespeare and Dantes
Aligerus.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, as we have said, he stands alone. We must skip fifteen
hundred years and come to Coleridge before we meet any critic
entirely of his class, yet free from some of his limitations. The
hand of the author of the Περὶ Ὕψους is not subdued, but raised
to what he deals in. And his work remains towering among all
other work of the class, the work of a critic at once Promethean
and Epimethean in his kind, learning by the mistakes of all
that had gone before, and presaging, with instinctive genius,
much that was not to come for centuries after.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r202'>202</a>. We are, however, by no means so
fortunate (from the point of view of
this book) in our remains of Greek
Symposiacs as we are in those of Latin.
The famous <i>Deipnosophists</i> of Athenæus,
in which, about 230 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, its
invaluable author accumulated (under
the guise of a conversation in which
persons of the importance of Ulpian
and Galen took part) the most enormous
miscellany of quotation, anecdote,
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quodlibeta</i></span>, in ancient if not in all
literature, is, of course, for all its want
of literary form, a priceless book. As
a storehouse of quotation it has no
rival but the <cite>Anatomy of Melancholy</cite>:
and though it is, in spirit, unity, literary
gifts, and almost everything else,
as far below the <cite>Anatomy</cite> as one book
can be below another, it is from this
special point of view to be preferred to
it, because the vast majority of its
sources of quotation are lost. For the
history of literature, as for that of manners,
it is a mine of wealth; for the history
of literary criticism almost barren.
For expression Athenæus seems to have
had no care at all, though his curiosity
as to matter was insatiable, and as
nearly as possible indiscriminate. His
spirit is exactly that of the scholiasts
referred to in a former page; and
whether he is discussing the varieties
of vegetables and wines and oysters, or
the highly spiced and salted witticisms
of Athenian ladies of pleasure, or any
other subject, he hardly becomes a
critic for one moment, though no critic
can neglect him. Perhaps the nearest
approach to sustained critical remark
is the captious attack on Plato at
the end of the 11th book, which is as
feeble as it is captious. (The standard
edition of Athenæus is still that of
Schweighaüser (14 vols., Argentorati,
1801-7); but those who suffer from
inadequate shelf-room may have (as
the present writer long ago had regretfully)
to expel this in favour of
the far less handsome and useful, but
compacter, one of Dindorf (3 vols.
Leipsic, 1827).)</p>

<p class='c016'>PHOTIUS—DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THE ‘BIBLIOTHECA’—IMPORTANCE
OF ITS POSITION AS A BODY OF CRITICAL JUDGMENTS—TZETZES—JOHN
THE SICELIOTE.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the word Byzantine is not quite such a byword as it once
was, it still has for the most part an uncomplimentary connotation.
How far that connotation is justified in reference
to our special subject can hardly be better set forth than by
exposition of three books of the middle and later Byzantine
period.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c008'><sup>[242]</sup></a> The first shall be the remarkable and in a way famous
<cite>Bibliotheca</cite><a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c008'><sup>[243]</sup></a> of Photius in the ninth century; the second, the
<cite>Homeric Allegories</cite> of Tzetzes in the twelfth; the third, that
commentary on the περὶ ἰδέων of Hermogenes by John the
Siceliote in the thirteenth, which preserves to us our earliest
reference to what is almost certainly the Περὶ Ὕψους, and
assigns it to Longinus.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first is in its way unique. The author, it may be barely
necessary to say, was Patriarch of Constantinople for a period
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Photius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of nearly thirty years, though with an interval of
ten, during which he was deposed or deprived (858-867,
877-886), in the latter half of the ninth century. He was
originally a lay statesman, and, from causes no doubt political
as well as religious, was much engaged in the disputes which
led to the final separation between the Eastern and Western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Churches. His birth- and death-dates are not known; but he
was, in the year last mentioned—886—banished by Leo VI. to
a monastery in Armenia. The <cite>Bibliotheca</cite> purports to be an
account or review of books read during an embassy to Assyria,
written for the benefit, and at the request, of the author’s
brother Tarasius. There is no reason for questioning the
excellent Patriarch’s veracity; but if he actually took with him
the two hundred and eighty authors (some of them very voluminous)
whom he summarises, he must have had one of the
largest travelling libraries on record. The form is encyclopædic,
each author having a separate article beginning Ἀνεγνώθη,
“there was read:” and to a great extent these articles consist
of summaries of the matter of the books. This, as it happens,
is fortunate. Photius seems to have had a special fancy for
giving <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>précis</i></span> of narrative, whether ostensibly historical or avowedly
fictitious; and he has thus preserved for us all or almost
all that we know of things so interesting as the <cite>Persica</cite> of
Ctesias, and the <cite>Babylonica</cite> or <cite>Sinonis and Rhodanes</cite> of the
romancer Iamblichus. Naturally enough, a good deal of his
matter is theological, and his abstracts here are seasoned with
a sometimes piquant, but seldom strictly critical, animus. But
he by no means confines himself to mere summary, and we
have in his book what we have nowhere else—a sort of critical
review of a very large portion of Greek literature. Pretty full
abstract after his own manner, and some extract of this, will be
the best basis possible for considering the state of literary
study and taste at what was perhaps the only cultivated
capital of Europe, if not (putting the dimmer East out of
the question) of the world, at the time when the classical
languages were almost half a millennium past their real flourishing
time, and when as yet only Anglo-Saxon to certainty,
and some other Teutonic dialects probably, had arisen to represent
the new vernaculars in any kind of literary performance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Photius observes no order in his notices, which would appear
to be genuine notes of reading; and most of his earliest entries
are short, and devoted to writers possessing at best interest of
matter. The first that has struck me as possessing the interest
of literature is Art. 26, on Synesius. The characterisation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>of the good Bishop of Ptolemaïs runs thus: “As for phrase, he
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Detailed examination of the</i> Bibliotheca.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
is lofty and has ὄγκος” (the word we encounter so
often and find so hard to translate), “but swerves off
to the over-poetical.” “His miscellaneous epistles”
(the judgment just quoted is on his philosophical
treatises on Providence, on Monarchy, &amp;c.) “drip with grace and
pleasure,<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c008'><sup>[244]</sup></a> not without strength and substance<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c008'><sup>[245]</sup></a> of thought.”
The rest is personal and religious, but extremely interesting.</p>

<p class='c001'>Art. 44 deals with Philostratus and his famous life of Apollonius
of Tyana. The bulk of the notice, as we should expect,
both from the Patriarch’s fancy for analysis of narrative and
from his religious bent, is busied with the matter; but we have
some actual criticism. He is as to his phrase “clear, graceful,
and aphoristic, and teeming with sweetness;<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c008'><sup>[246]</sup></a> bent on obtaining
honour by archaism and the fashionableness [or new-fangledness]
of his constructions.”<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c008'><sup>[247]</sup></a> Josephus has Art. 47. He is
“clean in phrasing, and clever at setting forth the intention
of his speech distinctly and pleasantly; persuasive and agreeable
in his speeches even if occasion compels him to speak in
different senses; fertile in enthymemes on either side, and
with gnomæ at command if ever any man had them; also
most competent to infuse passions into his discourse, and a
proved hand at awaking compassion and softening the reader.”
All which (observe the strict rhetorical form of it) is very
handsome towards that Ebrew Jew. The note (49) on Cyril
of Alexandria, that he “keeps the character and idiom of the
appropriate speech,” that “his style is fashioned and, as it were,
forced to express idiosyncratic idea,”<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c008'><sup>[248]</sup></a> and “is like loose poetry
that disdains metre,” is itself thoroughly idiosyncratic, and
speaks Cyril very well. Two others, 55 and 75, of a somewhat
acrid character, on Johannes Philoponus (“Matæoponus rather,”
quoth our Patriarch), are, though acrid, by no means uncritical.
All these are late and mainly ecclesiastical writers, though of
a certain general literary interest. The first author, at once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>of considerable age and of purely literary value, to be very
fully handled is the above-mentioned Ctesias, and we have
only fragments whereby to control Photius’s criticism of him.
But the paragraph which comes at the end of the abstract of
the <cite>Persica</cite>, and applies both to that and to the <cite>Indica</cite>, is itself
worth abstracting. “This historian is very clear and simple in
language, so that his style is mixed with much pleasure. He
uses the Ionic dialect, not throughout, like Herodotus, but
partially. Nor does he, like that writer, divert his story to
unseasonable digressions. But from the mythical matters with
which Herodotus is reproached neither does Ctesias abstain,
especially in the book called <cite>Indica</cite>. Still, the pleasure of his
history consists chiefly in the arrangement of his narrative,
which is strong in the pathetic and unexpected, and in the
variation of it by dint of the mythical. His style is slipshod
more than is fitting, often falling into mere vulgarity. But
the style of Herodotus, both in this and other respects of the
power and art of the Word, is the canon of the Ionic dialect.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Appian’s <cite>Roman History</cite> and Arrian’s <cite>Parthica</cite> come in
for successive notice, but there is nothing about the latter’s
literary character till the much later and fuller notice of
his Alexander-book at 91, where Photius, as is specially his
wont with historians, gives a full appreciation. The pupil
of Epictetus, he thinks, "is second to none among those who
have best drawn up histories, for he is both first-rate at
succinct narration, and he never hurts the continuousness of
his history by unseasonable divagations and parentheses.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c008'><sup>[249]</sup></a> He
is original [“new-fangled,” the usual translation of καινοπρεπὴς,
has a too unfavourable twist in it], rather by the arrangement
of his words than by his vocabulary; and he manages this
in such a fashion that hardly otherwise could the tale be
told more clearly and luminously. He uses a vivid, euphonious,
well-turned style, and has smoothness well mixed with
grandeur.<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c008'><sup>[250]</sup></a> His neologisms are not directed to mere innovation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à perte de vue</i></span>,<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c008'><sup>[251]</sup></a> but close and emphatic, so as to be
real figures of speech and not merely change for ordinary
words.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c008'><sup>[252]</sup></a> Wherefore clearness is his companion, not merely in
this respect, but most of all in the arrangement and order
and constitution of his style, which is the very craft-secret
of clearness. For the use of merely straightforward periods
is within the power of mere uncultivated persons,<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c008'><sup>[253]</sup></a> and, if it
be maintained without admixture, brings the style down to flatness
and meanness, whereto Arrian, clear as he is, has not
approached. And he makes use of elliptic figures not in
respect of his period but of his diction, so as never to become
obscure: if any one should attempt to supply what
is wanting, it would seem to tend towards the superfluous,
and not really to complete the ellipse. The variety of his
figures is also one of his strongest points—not changing
at once from simple usage, but forming themselves gently
and from the beginning, so as neither to annoy with satiety
nor to worry by overcrowding. In short, if any be set
against him in the matter of historical composition, many
even of the old classics<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c008'><sup>[254]</sup></a> would be found his inferiors in
<cite>taxis</cite>."</p>

<p class='c001'>Appian has earlier had less elaborate praise, as being terse
and plain in phrase, as truth-loving as possible, an expounder
of strategic methods, and very good indeed at raising the depressed
spirit of an army, or soothing its excitement, and
exhibiting passion by means of speeches. It is odd enough,
after the exaltation of Arrian—a good writer but no marvel—to
the skies, to come across the following brief and grudging
estimate, inserted in the shortest of summaries, of a man of
the highest genius like Herodotus. Photius here, as elsewhere,
does justice to the Halicarnassian as a canon of Ionic. “But
he employs all manner of old wives' fables and divagations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>whereby an intellectual sweetness runs through him,<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c008'><sup>[255]</sup></a> though
these things sometimes obscure the comprehension of the
history and efface its proper and corresponding type, since
truth will not have her clearness clouded by myths, nor admit
divagations (<i>parecbaseis</i>) further than is fitting.” This is rather
dispiriting for the first really great writer whom we meet; and
the long judgment upon Æschines, which follows shortly, makes
little amends, because the orators had been criticised and characterised
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad nauseam</i></span> for a thousand years. Later we have no
ill criticism of Dion Cassius—indeed Photius seems more at
ease with post-Christian writers, even if they be non-Christians,
than with the classics proper, or ἀρχαῖοι as he calls them. The
careful and somewhat artificial style of this historian, his
imitation of Thucydides, and some other things, are well but
briefly noted.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is evident that the good Patriarch was no sparing or infrequent
novel-reader, for, as has been said, he is copious both
on some novels that we have and on one that we have not.
The somewhat monotonous form, however, of the Lower Greek
Romance gives him more room for analysis of story than for
criticism of art. He justly extols the propriety of Heliodorus,
is properly shocked by the looseness of Achilles Tatius, and
puts the lost Iamblichus between them in this respect. His
criticism of the <cite>Æthiopica</cite>—of many million novel reviews
the interesting first—may be given, apart, of course, from
the argument of the book, which, as is usual with him, and
not uncommon with his followers to-day, forms the bulk of
the article.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The book (<i>syntagma</i>) is of the dramatic kind [this is noteworthy],
and it uses a style suitable to the plan, for it abounds
in simplicity and sweetness, and in pathetic situations actual
or expected. The narrative is diversified and unexpected, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>has strange chance salvations<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c008'><sup>[256]</sup></a> and bright and pure diction.
If, as is reasonable, it sometimes indulges in tropes, they, too, are
brilliant, and exhibit the matter in hand. The periods are
symmetrical and, on the whole, arranged with a view to
succinctness. The plot and the rest are correspondent to the
style. His yarn<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c008'><sup>[257]</sup></a> is of the love of a man and a woman, and
he shows an anxious and careful observance of propriety of
sentiment.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In Art. 77, on the not very interesting subject of Eunapius,
we have the familiar phrase “New Edition” in its literal Greek
form.<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c008'><sup>[258]</sup></a> A fresh example of the interest he takes in history
appears under the head of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and
in Art. 90 Libanius supplies him with occasion for criticising
a rhetorician pure and simple. He is, he thinks, exhibited to
the best advantage<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c008'><sup>[259]</sup></a> in his “plasmatic” [speeches written on
imaginary topics] and gymnastic discourses rather than in his
others, for by his excessive elaboration and busybodyness<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c008'><sup>[260]</sup></a> in
these others he has hurt the grace and charm of the,<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c008'><sup>[261]</sup></a> as one
may say, naïf and impromptu style, and deprived it of verisimilitude,
causing frequent obscurity by insertions, and sometimes
even by abstraction of the necessary. “But in other respects
he is a canon and standard of Attic speech.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucian and the mysterious Lucius of Patræ seem to have
occupied him together, and he discusses the authorship of the
<cite>Ass</cite> with some acumen, recognising in Lucian a merely satiric
intention, in Lucius a serious belief in magic and marvels. As
for Lucian himself (respecting whom he has preserved for us
the great epigram quoted above), he acknowledges the universality
of the Samosatan’s satire of all things Greek, their god-making
and their <i>Aselgeia</i>, the extravagances of their poets and
their political mistakes, the emptiness and pretentiousness of their
philosophy. In fact, says Photius, in an approach at least to
the true Higher Criticism, “his whole pains are spent on producing
a prose Comedy of Greek things. He himself seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>be one of those who worship nothing seriously; he scoffs and
mocks at other’s doxies, but lays down no creed of his own,
unless one should say that it is a creed to be creedless. In
style he is of the very best, brilliant and classical, and signally
distinguished in diction, and of all others a lover of good order
and purity, with a clear and symmetrical magnificence. His
composition is arranged so that the reader seems not to be
reading prose, and as though a very pleasant song, without
distinct musical accompaniment, were dropping into the ears of
the hearers. And altogether, as we said, his style is of the very
best, and ill-matched with the subjects at which he chose to
laugh.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Photius is not lavish of the word <i>aristos</i>, and it is only fair
to say that, for its day and way, this criticism is not far itself
from deserving the epithet.</p>

<p class='c001'>After some shorter notices, including a good many of Lexicons
(Photius himself, it need hardly be said, was a lexicographer),
we come, at Art. 159, to Isocrates, on whom the
Byzantine judgment is again noteworthy. He has more,
Photius thinks, of the sophist than, like the other Nine, of the
actual advocate. “His readers can see at once that he employs
a distinct and pure style, and shows a great deal of care about
the craftsmanship of his speeches, so that his order and his care
overreach themselves a little and become excessive. In fact,
this excess of apparatus does not so much provide genuine
arguments as tasteless ineptitude.”<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c008'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Again, he is wanting in ethical character and truth and
nervousness of style (γοργότης.) Of sublimity, so far as it suits
political discourses, he mixes a very good dose, and suitably to
his clearness. But his style is more languid<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c008'><sup>[263]</sup></a> than it ought to
be. And he is not least blamed for attention to trifles, and a
balancing of clauses<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c008'><sup>[264]</sup></a> which disgusts. But we say this in reference
to the excellence of his speeches, pointing out what fails,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>and is exceptional in them, inasmuch as in comparison with
some of those who have made bold to write speeches, even
his shortcomings would appear to be excellence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Immediately before this article on Isocrates there is a very
shrewd note (and one which is “for thoughts” to any one who
has ever written books) on the <cite>Sophistike Paraskeue</cite> of Phrynichus.
“This writer, if any ever was, is fullest of various
knowledge, but otherwise redundant and garrulous: <i>for when
it was open to him to have got the matter completely finished off,
without missing a single important point, in not a fifth part of
his actual length, he, by saying things out of season, has stretched
it out to an unmanageable bulk; and while he has collected for
others' use the matter of a good and suitable treatise, he cannot
be said to have made much use of it himself</i>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be possible to extend these excerpts and abstracts
very considerably from my notes of reading the great mass
of the <cite>Bibliotheca</cite>; though the larger part of that mass is
itself made up, not of literary criticisms at all, but, as has been
said, of summaries, abstracts, and extracts. In not a few cases
the longest articles deal with commentaries or anthologies,
the Platonic studies of the rhetorician Aristides, the <i>meletæ</i>
or declamations of Himerius, the <cite>Bibliotheca</cite> of Diodorus, the
fortunately still extant Commonplace-books of Stobæus, and
the like. But the foregoing pages have probably given sufficient
foundation for a study of the Photian position, which
may be taken, without rashness, as a very favourable representative
of Byzantine criticism generally.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c008'><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In making this estimate we must first of all take note of
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Importance of its position as a body of critical judgment.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
certain limitations, which may be accidental but
which also may not. It is at least curious that he
never deals directly with a poet. Even his indirect
references, borrowed from his authors, to the greater
Greek verse-writers are few, and, speaking with the
reserves due in the case of so voluminous and peculiar a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>compilation as the <cite>Bibliotheca</cite>, I do not remember any independent
poetical criticism of his. On the other hand, such
criticisms as those which have been quoted above on Lucian, on
Isocrates, on Phrynichus, and others, show, in the first place, no
contemptible critical acumen, and in the second place, a critical
attitude which is worthy of a good deal of attention. For the
literary characteristics of his authors Photius distinctly “has a
good eye”: he can see a church by daylight and a little more
also. We may even say that he shows a good deal more
detachment, more faculty of seeing his man in the round, than
any purely classical critic displays. Here and there, as in his
eulogy of Arrian, he is a little too technically rhetorical, and has
evidently not got rid of the notion of the Figures as things
possessing a real existence. And there is more than a trace in
him of the growth of that critical jargon which has been
noticed above, certain phrases recurring rather too often, like
“gusto” with old-fashioned critics, and divers terms, which it is
not necessary to mention, with new-fangled ones. But technicalities
are, at their worst, an evidence that the <cite>techne</cite> exists.
Further, it would be, as has been seen, extremely unjust to
regard Photius as a mere phrase-monger. His criticism of
Lucian is as comprehensive as it is shrewd, it is “criticism of
life” as well as criticism of literature; that of Isocrates shows
that he was not to be caught by mere scholastic elegance; that
of Phrynichus, that he had an eye for method; his notices of
the Romancers, that he could appreciate and relish kinds out of
the beaten track of classical literary classification and practice;
the remark on “merely straightforward periods” is a just and
shrewd one. Not only would Photius have made an exceedingly
good reviewer, but we may say that he is almost the patriarch
of reviewers in two senses, that he is the first of all such as
have dealt practically with literature from the reviewer’s point
of view.</p>

<p class='c001'>To say this is of course not to give unmitigated and indisputable
praise. There is no lack of advocates of the devil who
will say that the reviewer’s point of view is not easily found in
a very original age, or by a very original genius. It may be so—the
age of Photius himself was certainly not a very original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>age, except in countries where the point of view of the reviewer
was as certainly quite unknown. But this is not the question
for us; the question for us is, Have we met this attitude? Have
we come upon any one occupying this point of view before?
And the answer must, I think, be, “No; we have not.” Dionysius,
of all our writers, comes nearest to it, for Quintilian is too
summary, and Longinus is considering rather a single quality
of literature, as shown in divers authors, than divers authors by
themselves, and as presenting a combination of qualities in each
case. What we would give almost anything for is a collection
of such reviews by Aristotle; and we have not got them. We
do not know that Aristotle ever thought of such a thing,<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c008'><sup>[266]</sup></a> though
he might well have made it as a preparation for the <cite>Rhetoric</cite>
and the <cite>Poetics</cite>, just as he made his collection of “polities” as
a preparation for the <cite>Politics</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The absence of poetical criticism from Photius is specially to
be regretted, because it leaves us in doubt as to his power of
recognising and analysing, not merely the finer subtleties of
form, but the more complex and interesting kinds of literary
matter. His own interests, it is pretty clear, were, though he
had the liking for novels which is often found in men of science
and business, chiefly scientific, historical, and philosophical, including,
of course, religion in philosophy. There is probably no
Greek writer, whose subject in any way admitted of it, who has
said so little about Homer. In dealing with Stobæus he has
the patience (though, as has been seen, he is far from being a
mere enumerator) to enumerate all the heads of the <cite>Florilegium</cite>
and the <cite>Eclogæ</cite>, and all the authors, hundreds of them as there
are, whom the anthologist has laid under contribution. But he
is tempted into no critical asides about them. He is essentially
positive—frankly busied with matter, or with the more material
side of form.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet to the historian of criticism he has a singular interest,
because of that position of origin which has been noted.
Cicero and Pliny in their libraries were in a position to do
much the same thing; had, as we shall see, a kind of dim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>velleity of doing it now and then, but did it not. Athenæus, if
he had cared less for cooks and courtesans, more for literature;
Aulus Gellius and Macrobius, if mere philology on the one
hand, and mere folk-lore and mythology on the other, had not
drawn them aside, would probably have anticipated him. But
no one actually has; none has applied to the library or its prose
division the process which goes to the making of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>catalogue
raisonné</i></span> in painting. No doubt Photius leaves a good deal to
be done, independently of his silence on poetry and drama. His
comparison is so limited as to be almost non-existent; it is
much if he can compare Heliodorus, Iamblichus, and Achilles
Tatius in reference to the treatment of matters erotic; Ctesias
and Herodotus, on the score of resisting, or succumbing to,
story-telling digression. But even in this there is the germ,
the rudiment, of the great Comparative Method. So again the
other great Lamp of Criticism, the historical estimate, still has
its shutter drawn for him. A vague distinction between the
ἀρχαῖοι and the moderns is indeed not uncommon; but we
have, so far as I have noticed, no distinct line drawn between
the two, and both are huddled and jumbled together. Photius
has not yet risen to that highest conception of criticism which
involves the “grasping” of each author in his complete self, and
the placing of him in the general literary map or genealogy
(whichever phase may be preferred) of the world. And lastly,
the silly old etiquette of silence about Latin still seems to
weigh, if unconsciously, on him. He does indeed allude to
the birth-year of Virgil. In his notices of historians of Rome
he necessarily has to mention some Roman matters, and he
mentions that Cicero was slain while reading the <cite>Medea</cite>. But
my memory, assisted by Bekker’s excellent index, traces no
critical remark, comparative or independent, about any great
Latin writer, and nothing more than the barest mention of one
or two by name. Yet, with all these drawbacks, the niche we
have indicated is securely his, though he has scarcely yet been
established in it.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c008'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>If an example be required between Photius and John, it
may be found (of no encouraging character) in the almost contemptible
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Tzetzes.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<cite>Homeric Allegories</cite> of Tzetzes<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c008'><sup>[268]</sup></a> written in
that dreary “political” verse, the only consolation
of which is the remembrance that, whether as origin or echo,
it has sometimes been connected with the charming <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Meum est
propositum</i></span> metre of the Latin Middle Ages. In Tzetzes, the
allegorical method neither reaches its pinnacle of fantasticality
as in the <cite>Romance of the Rose</cite>,—there is often something faintly
fascinating there,—nor attains to the rather imposing mazes
and meanderings of fifteenth-century personification, but
stumbles along in pedestrian gropings of this kind<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c008'><sup>[269]</sup></a> (on <cite>Il.</cite> i.
517 <i>sq.</i>): “The groaning of Zeus signifieth a puff of wind moving
the eyebrows of him, and conducting the thickness of clouds.
The downcoming of Thetis indicates that there was rain,
which is also a kind of consentment of assistance. And the
coming of Zeus to his own home is the restoration of the
atmosphere to its former condition, having thinned out the
thickness of the cloud to rain. The rising up of the gods
from their seats is the confusion and disturbance of the elements,”
&amp;c., &amp;c. The much-ridiculed allegorical morals of the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Gesta Romanorum</i></span> are sense, poetry, piety, to this ineffably dull
and childish attempt to substitute a cheap pseudo-scientific
Euhemerism for the criticism of literature. If Allegory had
not too profitably assisted at the cradle of Greek literature,
she certainly infested its death-bed in her most decrepit and
malignant aspect.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time, we must not be too contemptuous of
Byzantine criticism. Had the vast mass of the later rhetorical
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>John the Siceliote.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
scholiasts yielded nothing to the sifting but the
quotation in John the Siceliote (though as from the
<cite>Philological Homilies</cite>, not the Περὶ Ὕψους), by name, of the
Longinian censure on the <cite>Orithyia</cite>, it would almost be justified
in existing, not to mention references in others, one of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>shows us that in the same collection Longinus gave a discussion
(the tendency of which we can easily guess) on the
<i>stomphodes</i> or “mouthy.”<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c008'><sup>[270]</sup></a> But the siftings are not quite limited
to these two.</p>

<p class='c001'>John, who appears possibly, if not at all certainly, to have
had the surname of Doxopater, and to have been sometimes
designated by it, appears also to have been a monk. He must
(on his own authority) have observed the virtue of Poverty
much better than some of his fellows, and few of them can
have more avoided the vice of laziness. His voluminous works
devoted to Rhetoric are ranged by Walz<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c008'><sup>[271]</sup></a> under eleven titles:
to wit, Prolegomena and Homilies on the Progymnasmata of
Aphthonius, General Prolegomena to Rhetoric, Commentaries
on the States, Inventions and Ideas of Hermogenes, Epideictic
speeches on the Horse and against the Saracens, a destructive
discussion of the myth of Prometheus, a “Basileios” and
a “Politikon.” These works contain some personal details
and complaints, which, if he subsequently became Patriarch
of Constantinople, were heard by Fortune in her less
savage mood; and he seems to have busied himself with
theology and history, as well as rhetoric. But it is very
difficult to place either his patriarchate, or consequently his
life, chronologically. He might have been the John Glycas
who held the dignity from 1316 to 1320, when he abdicated;
but Glycas seems to have been married. So perhaps he was
John Camater, an earlier occupant (under the Latin Empire) of
the see in 1204.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this, it will be seen, is a rather unsubstantial pageant; but
John’s works are solid enough. Even the <cite>Prolegomena</cite> (taking
them as his) of Doxopater, and the <cite>Commentaries on the Ideas</cite>
(to which alone we have access), fill five hundred pages. It is
in the latter that we are to look for anything touching our
subject. They are rather wide-ranging, to which character of
theirs we doubtless owe the Longinian citation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Neither did John always observe that scrupulous accuracy
which is so dear to the heart of a certain class of critic, that, like
a true altruist, he would have every one, except himself, possess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>it. At the opening he writes “Themistocles” for “Miltiades.”
But his erudition is considerable, and his qualities in other
respects not contemptible. It is, however, very noticeable that
he is as much inclined to the general and disinclined from the
particular as if he had lived fifteen hundred years earlier. Although
he is no slavish Platonist (he has somewhere the happy
phrase Πλάτων Πλάτωνος ἀναξίως. “Did Plato? the less
Plato he”), he is fully Platonic in his scorn of the μερικαὶ
ἰδέαι, of the mere “characterising” speeches, Lysiac and Isocratean,
and so forth, and aims at the “circumprehensive and
comprehensive” idea and phrase which transcends all these.
Thus we are once more face to face with that putting of the
cart before the horse which has met us so often—with that
discussion of δεινότης and γλυκύτης which is no doubt a capital
thing in its way, but which ought to be preluded and, as
military men say, “prepared” by a long, by an almost infinite,
examination of the individual exponents and practitioners of
the Vigorous and the Sweet.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is, of course, fair to remember that he is annotating Hermogenes,
and that he can hardly be expected to follow methods
different from those of his text. But it necessarily follows that
his loyalty leads him away from the fields most likely to be
fertile for us, and, when he does approach them, directs him
mainly to the Orators, and to them chiefly, if not wholly, from
the strictly rhetorical point of view. Yet he is by no means ill
to read, though a little technical and abstract, on rhythm
(opening of Bk. i. chap. i.); and if he has gone no further in
reference to φαντασία than all before him except Philostratus,
that is no great reproach to him. Undoubtedly, however, his
chief—as at the same time his most tantalising—attraction is
his reference to things which, in his comparatively modern
period, must have still existed, but which seem now to be irrecoverably
lost. Such is his quotation, p. 93, of certain remarks
of Longinus on the poet Menelaus.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c008'><sup>[272]</sup></a> We may doubt
whether definite poetical criticism from the excellent John
would have been satisfactory, when we find him assigning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“out-and-out”<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c008'><sup>[273]</sup></a> poetical quality to the soft inanity of Isocrates,
and the want of it to the rough fire of Thucydides. Yet in
the lower and “composition-book” kind of criticism he is not
to seek—the synopsis of clearness at p. 173 being a very workmanlike
composition.<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c008'><sup>[274]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>And so, without further minute examination of this curiosity,
we may take some general view of it as the last words—or
fairly representative of the last words—of Greek rhetorical
criticism, unaffected by mediæval literature, unaffected even by
Latin, to any considerable, or at least avowed, extent, but
turning round and round the long-guarded treasures of its own
special hoard, like the dragons of fable. To us, perhaps, the hoard
does not seem very inviting. The enormous apparatus of distinction
and terminology is set to work, almost exclusively, on
matter which has neither the attraction of the highest æsthetic
problems, nor the practical interest and profit of direct literary
criticism of particulars. There is abundance of learning, and
by no means a dearth of mother-wit. But the worst side of
Scholasticism—the side which was long unjustly taken for the
whole, but which <em>is</em> a side thereof—makes itself almost universally
felt. Sometimes one almost thinks of one of the keenest,
if not the most generally delectable, strokes of Rabelaisian
satire, the duel of signs between Panurge and Thaumast. This
-<i>tes</i> and that -<i>ia</i> hurtle through the air almost without conveying
understanding, though they may darken a good deal. With
sufficient pains and goodwill, you may disinter many a shrewd
remark, many a really useful definition, many a scrap of precious
information, by no means unintelligently used. But on
the whole, the impression is as of the ghost of Rhetoric struggling
against being re-embodied as the soul of Criticism.</p>

  <h3 id='chi.1' class='c015'>INTERCHAPTER  I.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We have endeavoured, in the foregoing Book, to survey—from
the actual texts, and admitting no conjectural or theoretical
reconstruction—the history of literary criticism in Greece and
the Greek Empire till its fall. It is our duty in this first halt
to survey this survey—to see what results it actually gives us,
to classify and arrange them, to account for them as philosophically
as possible, and, without digressing into the quicksands
of theory, to lay down the solid road of logical and historical
perspective.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have seen that criticism in Greece began from two different
sources, neither of which, perhaps, was, or could have been
expected to be, likely to supply it in an absolutely unmixed
condition. There was, in the first place, the strong Greek
philosophising tendency, working upon the earliest documents
(the most important, then as now, identified with the name of
Homer), and subjecting them to processes which oftenest took
the form of a kind of rationalising allegory. The second was
the invention, for more or less practical purposes, of the art
of Rhetoric or Persuasive Composition. As, in the first place,
the collection of written literature was very small, and as the
oratorical character impressed itself more or less strongly upon
nearly <em>all</em> literature in the process of publication, this dominance
of Oratory was long maintained, and continued, almost to
the latest times, to prevent Rhetoric from assuming its proper
etymological position as “speech-craft” in the widest sense, as
the art of artificially arranged language.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this inconvenience, always more or less existing, was
mitigated by practice in divers ways. As actual literature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>both prose and verse, mustered and multiplied, and as it was
more and more enjoyed by the keen Greek appetite for
pleasures of all kinds, it at the same time presented more
and more temptation to the equally keen Greek aptitude for
philosophical inquiry. Larger and larger treasuries were made
available for quotation and imitation; more and more kinds
of literature were presented to the student for investigation,
classification, inquiry into sources, methods, effects. And so
after a century, or a century and a half, of progress and exercise,
of which little remains to us except the brilliant, but
from this point of view wayward, work of Plato, we are confronted,
in the work of Aristotle, with an Art of Poetry, incomplete
in certain ways, but singularly mature in its own way,
with an Art of Prose which, though it has not yet by any
means recognised its real nature and estate, and persists in
regarding itself as an Art of Persuasion merely, has yet
accumulated many valuable observations, and has made the
paths of future investigators fairly straight and smooth.</p>

<p class='c001'>While, however, the oratorical preoccupation prevented
Rhetoric from attaining the development which might otherwise
have been expected, both Rhetoric and Poetics were very
seriously obstructed by the unequal growth of literary kinds
within Greek itself, and by the absence of any other literature
with which to compare such kinds as existed, and by which to
discern the absence of those that did not exist. The whole of
Greek Poetic was prejudicially affected—and the affection has
continued to be a source of evil in all criticism since—by the
accidental lateness of prose fiction in Greek literature; just as
the whole of Greek Rhetoric was prejudicially affected by the
accidental predominance of Greek oratory. The habit—in the
main a sound one—of generalising from the actual facts, led to
very arbitrary theories of more literary kinds than one. It was
assumed that what we may call “periodic” Epic was the only
kind; and Romance, which may be very fairly called a “loose”
Epic, was barred as improper. Still more was the same distinction
ignored in drama; where a single, though in its way very
perfect, form of Tragedy was arbitrarily assumed to be the only
one possible or permissible. So the accidental and easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>separable extravagances and licences of the Ancient Comedy
were allowed to obscure its merits, and depress its rank, in the
eyes of the critic. Lyric—perhaps the very highest of all
literary kinds, as it must be the oldest, and is the most perennial—became
a mere appendage to tragedy. The great kind of
History, in which Greece had already produced such magnificent
examples, was in the same way regarded as a sort of baggage-waggon
to oratorical Rhetoric; and the dialogic form which was
preferred in philosophy, partly owing to the habits of the
nation, and partly owing to the towering eminence of Plato,
was in the same way, or much the same way, allowed or
forced to attach itself to the same train.</p>

<p class='c001'>But these mischiefs, though sufficiently considerable, and
assisted by the ignorance (changed latterly in the worse days
to a contemptuous ignoring) of other languages, were by no
means the equals of those caused directly by this ignorance,
while they were aggravated by it in every way. If, while we
are certainly not superior to the ancients in most branches of
literature, where comparison is possible, we may challenge
them more safely in criticism, it is due almost, if not quite
wholly, to what has been called the illegitimate advantage
of our possession of an infinitely larger stock of accumulated
literature, and of the fact that this literature is distributed over
the most various times, nations, and languages. It is the rarest
thing at any time to find a critic of the first class who is not
acquainted with literatures besides his own; and it is almost
invariable to find that the mistakes which great critics make
arise out of ignorance or forgetfulness of other literatures
besides their own. But even in antiquity there is no critic
of, or approaching, this first class, except Aristotle, who suffered
the full exposure to this disability. As a “tongue of comparison”
Longinus knew Latin: Dionysius and Quintilian, who, if
not critics of the first class, are not far off it, knew, the one
Latin, the other Greek. But Aristotle (unless the legends
about Alexander having sent him Indian communications have
any basis, and unless we take the references of Plato and
others to Egyptian stories as having much more solid ground
than there is any reason to accord them) had none, and could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>have had none: while, even if he had been stocked with Egyptian
and Sanscrit, these would have done him but little good, though
they might have corrected his delusions as to the necessary connection
of poetry and fiction. It must always be reckoned as
one of the most fatal proofs of the literary inferiority of the
Roman genius that the younger literature, though it enjoyed
the bilingual advantage to the full, made so little advance on
the older in criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the three centuries between Aristotle and Dionysius we
are but ill provided with original texts. But both from what
we have, and from such notices as are trustworthy, we can be
tolerably sure that attention was almost entirely devoted, on the
one side to the verbal or material criticism of the Alexandrian
and Pergamene schools, on the other to technical Rhetoric. Now
the former, though a most necessary ancilla to literary appreciation
proper, is always to be kept in proper subordination to
her mistress; and the conditions of the latter, though in
one sense favourable to criticism (inasmuch as the stock of
actual literature was always increasing, and the temptation to
turn to it from mere declamation-making might at least be
expected to be always stronger), was in itself becoming more
and more a futile technique. Symbouleutic oratory (above
vestry rank) was killed and kept dead by the petty tyrants, the
less successors of Alexander, and lastly the Roman rule.
Judicial Rhetoric tended to confine itself to minor causes.
Only Epideictic, the most dangerous of the kinds, began to
flourish more and more, and resulted by degrees, as we have
seen, in the creation of a singular profession or pseudo-profession,
the members of which had about them something of the
travelling lecturer, something of the popular preacher, something—nay,
a good deal—of the hack book-maker, and not a
little of the journalist pure and simple. Their own study of
literature, unless they kept to the stock passages of the textbooks,
must have been fairly thorough; but literature was to
them partly what Burton’s <cite>Anatomy</cite> was to Captain Shandon, a
mere dictionary of quotations, partly a collection of patterns.
Very rarely did they take it by itself even for the canvas of
one of their show-orations, and when they did it was seldom or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>never from the point of view of appreciation of strictly literary
beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>For about half a century before and a century after the
Christian era the record, even putting Latin criticism aside
altogether, is a more distinct one. Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
Plutarch, and Dion Chrysostom, give us a good deal more
material than we have yet had. But the results of the inspection
of it are not wholly satisfactory. Dionysius of
Halicarnassus is, as has been said, perhaps our typical specimen
of the literary critic of antiquity. He has far less force
and method and originality than Aristotle; but then he is
a student confining himself to Rhetoric and History, not a
world-philosopher, taking up the philosophy of literature
merely as part of a whole. He has far less genius than
Longinus; but he is also far more copiously preserved. We
read him with respect; we meet just and acute observations
in him, we can even occasionally compliment him on something
like (never quite) the “grasp” of the comic fragment.
But he is still partly under the limitations of his technical
rhetoric, partly under others less easy to describe exactly;
and he neglects Latin literature, by his time a very considerable
entity. He cannot wholly bring himself to regard literature
as literature. With Plutarch the case is much worse, for
it is evident that he will not do this at all. It is an educating
and ethical influence; a convenient storehouse of fact and
example; a respectable profession; but not a great, a sovereign,
and an infinitely delightful art. As for Dion (the most literary
of the pure rhetoricians, and a favourable example of them), he
is only an entertainer, the showman of another art, which is
not quite coarse, but is certainly not in the highest sense fine.
Lucian, somewhat later, is a true artist, a true man of letters,
and occasionally a critic, endowed with unerring eyes and the
very Sword of Sharpness <a id='corr195.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='itself'>itself,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_195.32'><ins class='correction' title='itself'>itself,</ins></a></span> but he is this only at times,
and even at those times he is too negative.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we advance a little in point of time and turn our attention
to the strict teaching and practice of Rhetoric itself, from the
second century onward, and probably backward almost to the
very time of Aristotle, the spectacle is even less satisfactory.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>The work, of which Hermogenes and Aphthonius are the coryphæi,
leading an innumerable chorus of followers and commentators,
who continue for more than a thousand years, is
not exactly contemptible work. Work conducted with extreme
diligence and also, at any rate in some cases, with
remarkable alertness and acuteness of mind, can never be
wholly contemptible. But it is work disappointing, unsatisfying,
and even irritating to the last degree. The technical
Rhetoric, always arbitrarily limited in subject and perversely
conventional in method, has practically lost all chance of
exercising itself in the noblest of its three divisions. Deliberative
oratory is dead, except in exercises and make-believes,
and the bread-winning chicanery of forensic, the
frivolities (hollow except as also bread-winning) of epideictic,
have usurped the whole room. It might be thought that
in this bereaved condition the art would bethink itself of
that profitable, dignified and delightful application which it
had always more or less directly practised, but which had
seemed less dignified than Persuasion—the art of literary
criticism proper. But it does nothing—or but little—of the
kind. The remarks of Hermogenes on Frigidity are not bad;
the doubtful Demetrius, in his study of Interpretation, is
not far from the true kingdom others approach it here and
there. The invention of that critical “lingo,” to which reference
has more than once been made, is something, though a
something liable to abuse, and capable of standing in the
way of better things. But, on the whole, the endless procession
of some fifty generations, from the author of the
<cite>Rhet. ad Alex.</cite> to John of Sicily, busies itself either on the
one hand with endless distinctions, systematisations, and
terminologies, with everlastingly twining strands of new colour
into the rope that lets down the bucket into the empty well,
and varying the staves and hoops of the bucket itself; or on
the other with the provision of cut-and-dried patterns for the
use of the brainless, with telling tongue-tied sophists what they
are to say at the funeral of a fifth cousin, and how to make
the most of a harbour which is dry for three-quarters of
every tide.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Amidst all this desert and chaos of wasted industry there
stands the great rock of the Περὶ Ὕψους with its shade and
refreshment in the weary land of its own contemporaries,
and with its brow catching the dawn which was not to shine
fully for more than fifteen hundred years, and is hardly noon-day
yet. In the section devoted to it we have examined, as
thoroughly as our limits permitted, the special merits and
defects of this great little book; it is only necessary here
to lay a slight additional stress on the fact that if it be not
the sole book of antiquity—the sole book, except Dante’s,
of antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the
earlier modern times—to set forth that critical ideal which
comprehends the formal and the material, the verbal and
the ideal merits of literature, it exhibits this comprehension
as no other book does. To confine ourselves to our present
special subject—the criticism of Greek antiquity—Plato may
alternate noble flights with curious crotchets about literature;
Aristophanes may criticise from the point of view of robust
common-sense which is yet not in the least Philistine; Aristotle
may have almost a mathematical grasp of his own
notions of form, and a generous enthusiasm for certain kinds
of dignity in subject and proportion; Dionysius may show
that adherence to technique (and a rather vicious technique
too) is quite compatible with genuine literary appreciation.
But all these, and much more others, have their eyes mainly
off the object. Aristotle himself at times, lesser men like
Plutarch, who have misread their Plato, continually, seem to
think it rather vain to look at that object at all. The intelligent
enjoyment of literature; the intimacy with it, at once
voluptuous and intellectual; the untiring, though it may be
never fully satisfied, quest after the secret of its charms, never
neglecting the opportunity of basking and revelling in them—these
things, till we come to Longinus, are rare indeed.
And when we do meet them, the rencontre is of a sort of
accidental and shamefaced character. When we come to
Longinus there is no more false modesty. “Beautiful words
are the light of thought.” These words themselves are the
lantern of criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Elsewhere it gleams more faintly; though it would be as
ungrateful as it would be Philistine to ignore the debt which
we owe to others, from Aristotle himself downwards. It is
characteristic of Greek criticism—and it is the secret of its
weakness as well as of its strength—that it is more busy with
kinds than with authors, with authors than with books. And
when it is busy with authors at all, it is hardly ever busy
with them as wholes, as phenomena occupying an individual
place in the literary cosmos; but almost always as examples
of this or that quality, as supplying illustrations of this or
that Figure, as giving a good pattern for such-and-such a
progymnasma, a model for dealing with such-and-such a stasis.
Proceeding in this way, criticism attempts—and fails—to be
scientific; it renounces its right to be artistic, and effects the
renunciation. The individual <i>ethos</i> of the poet, the more solid
but not less individual <i>ethos</i> of the proseman, flies off and melts
away, when each is merely regarded as an example of “<i>todetes</i>”
or “<i>tallotes</i>” as a lecturer’s cabinet, in which you put your
hand to draw out an illustration of Anadiplosis or Palillogia.
Almost may the most idealist of metaphysical students think
of turning to sheer Hobbism, of blaspheming “<i>nesses</i> and <i>tudes</i>
and <i>ties</i>,” when he sees them dragged in and abused after this
fatal fashion, which even Aristotle does not wholly escape, and
in which others indulge as if it were their sole and legitimate
business.</p>

<p class='c001'>It follows that, except for the stock contrast of Herodotus
and Thucydides, in respect of the Orators (the exception being
there due to an obvious reason), and to a less extent of the
Three Tragedians, we have very few studies at once comprehensive
and comparative of authors in Greek, and that, out of
Longinus, such studies as we have are scrappy, technical, and
altogether lacking in that critical συνάρπασμα which the great
<i>locus</i> of Simylus requires. There is really no second passage in
Greek which can be put alongside of the Longinian estimate of
the <cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, agree or disagree as we may with the
details of this.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another and a very important matter (which it is fairer
and more philosophical to call rather a defect of our understanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>than a defect of the matter presented to it) lies in that
impossibility of attaining the Greek standpoint as to certain
rhythmical and verbal matters, which has been more than once
glanced at, and which is instanced in the case of Longinus
himself. Few among the wiser even of those who have paid
special attention to the subjects of Greek music and Greek
pronunciation would, I think, assert, that they thoroughly
understand the passages relating to prose rhythm, and the
special suitableness of the cretic and some of the pæons as
the base-feet for it. And it is practically admitted by most
sober and well-instructed critics that both Aristotle and
Longinus make strictures upon things as “frigid” and in bad
taste, that they ostracise metaphors and ban conceits which
to any modern criticism (putting aside mere assentation) seem
perfectly harmless, if not positively admirable. The same thing
occurs in English and French to this day, although in this case
all the difficulties which beset us in relation to Greek disappear,
except the radical difference of national (not now even of
temporal) ear and brain. A phrase of Bossuet, which seems to
French ears even of to-day the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ne plus ultra</i></span> of majestic melody,
will strike very well-instructed Englishmen as a rhetorical
jingle and French critics of enthusiasm and enlightenment will
see no difference between the music of Moore and that of
Shelley, or rather prefer the former. In the other sphere, what
is to an Englishman a piece of dry humour will appear to a
Frenchman a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>saugrenu</i></span> monstrosity; and a Frenchman’s ideal
of manly eloquence, dignified or passionate as the case may be,
will seem to an Englishman to show nothing but the maudlin
pathos of a drunkard, or the petulant braggadocio of a child.
Yet here there are innumerable side-lights, a long course of
partially identical history, literature, and religion, the experience
of persons of both nations who have lived in and with the
other, to guide us. No wonder that, when we have none of these
things, we should be puzzled. Yet the quarrel, such as it is,
with the Greek critics, is not so much that their estimates,
low or high, differ from ours, as that they have given us so
few documents from their own side to help out the contrast.
Even one essay, on both the literatures, by a Greek to set over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>against the invaluable survey by Quintilian would be not
merely something for which we could gladly exchange most
of the Greek writers on Rhetoric, except Aristotle, but something
in consideration of which we would gladly read all these
writers, and make no complaint of them. As it is, we have
to go to Photius, a representative of a time and thought far
more alien from those of the Greeks proper than is Quintilian
himself, for full review of even Greek writers, and he also is
silent about Latin.</p>

<p class='c001'>But “something sealed the mouths of these Evangelists.” It
is perhaps not unphilosophical to think that this silence was the
price the world had to pay for the confident and magnificent
advance which it made under the guidance of the Greek genius.
If that genius had been less confident, if it had assumed less
cavalierly that no other literature could be worth taking into
account, if it had hesitated and faltered about systematising
boldly whatever had been produced by itself, and allowing
everything else (if anything else existed) to go κατ’ οὖρον,
what we have would probably not have been vouchsafed to us.
And in that case we should, as probably, never have made up
the loss. The estimable but not wise persons who try to make
out that the undoubtedly rich and great languages and literatures
of Modern Europe can supply substitutes for those of
Greece and Rome overlook, ignore, or perhaps are honestly
ignorant of, the fact that the very strong points of these
modern languages and literatures, their Romantic ebb and flow,
their uncertainty, their complaisance to the vagaries of the
individual, their lack of logical system and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ordonnance</i></span>, make
it impossible that they should ever give us the principles of
fixity which we find in the Classical tongues. Those of us
who, far more by chance and good fortune than by any deliberate
and virtuous <i>proairesis</i>, happen to be acquainted pretty
equally with both Ancient and Modern Literature, know that
neither will do alone, but that for the education both of the
world at large and of any epoch of it, the Ancient is even
more necessary than the Modern.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some idea of the positive extent of our debts to Greek is
necessary to this history, though a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>résumé</i></span> of them is no easy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>thing to give. In the first place has to be reckoned the laying
of the foundations of mere grammar—the preliminary to every
kind of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>graphica lexis</i></span>. This must have been done pretty early,
and there is no language in the literary record with which it
could be done for the first time to so much advantage as with
<a id='corr201.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Greek'>Greek.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_201.6'><ins class='correction' title='Greek'>Greek.</ins></a></span> Some languages, as Latin and its daughter French, have
a sort of peddling tendency to purely arbitrary rule, and to enforced
observance of it. Others, the chief example of which is
English, have had too haphazard a history, and are too much
of ingrained rebels to strict convention, to admit of elaborate
grammar, despite the athletic attempts which are sometimes
made to discover it in them. Between these two, Greek presents
not so much the happy mean as the consummate union of all
the best qualities. It evidently possessed, from the remotest
time at which we have any traces of literature, an innate sense
of proportion and grammatical symmetry to guide it, first into
unconscious and then into conscious symmetry of accidence
and syntax, besides a native melody at once sweet, vigorous,
and disciplined, which made it the ideal raw material for prosody.
On the other hand, the intense philosophical spirit of the
Greeks, and their love of liberty, saved them from the hard and
fast irrationality of the grammars of some languages, and from
the tendency, not merely to make arbitrary rules, but to insist
on their observance with absolute rigidity. The result was a
grammar which to this day is the pattern grammar of the world—as
flexible as it is symmetrical, as intelligently free as it is
philosophically policed,—an eternal harmony of idiom and rule.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have glanced in the above paragraph at Prosody, but
something more must be said on this head, for the debt of
literary criticism to Greek in this respect is almost the mightiest
item of the total account. The mathematical element, which
distinguishes this part of Grammar, enables a people with a
suitable language, and a sufficient stock of experiments in it, to
discover something much more like a universal calculus than is
possible in Accidence and Syntax; and the Greeks discovered
this. Prosody is a science which, in its pure, though of course
not in its applied, divisions, as regards strictly metrical writing,
they practically found out once for all.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>There are systems of rhythm—early Latin probably, early
Teutonic certainly—to which this prosody does not apply, except
partially, if it applies at all. But all poetries that depend
upon <em>metre</em>—that is to say, on the arrangement of equivalenced
syllabic values in certain recurring orders—are governed by the
laws which the Greeks discovered, and which the Greeks exemplified.
On this side, therefore (and it is a most important
side), the literary critic owes them everything. They have
furnished him with every tool that he requires for taking to
pieces the mechanism of the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>, as well as of the
choruses, of the <cite>Agamemnon</cite>, of the odes of Hugo as well as of
those of Pindar, of the <cite>Nordsee</cite> of Heine as of the fragments of
Sappho and Alcæus. And it is not at all improbable that if we
possessed more of their work on prose rhythm, that subject
also, and the kindred one of the so-called accentual rhythms
of Latin and early Teutonic verse, would be almost as much
facilitated.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we pass beyond these elements and come to the
general subject of Rhetoric (which, it must be remembered, in at
least some places is recognised as covering the whole of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>graphica
lexis</i></span>) and Poetics, the advances in both departments, but especially
in the latter, are still very great, if not so great proportionately.
We have only one poetical kind—that of Tragedy,
as understood by the Greeks themselves, and practised by the
three great tragedians—which has been subjected to a thorough
critical examination in extant text. But then this examination
is so thorough that, in reference to the particular kind, hardly
anything has been added since. We have, in reference to the
capital example of another kind, Epic (again as understood by
the Greeks), a large variety of treatments, from Aristotle to
Longinus, which, if they do not give as firm and systematic a
theory of this as of the former, yet go far towards doing so.
Of the remaining divisions of poetry we learn, it must be confessed,
less from the Greeks; and even in examples we are,
except in so far as the Ode and the Idyl are concerned, very
lamentably ill supplied. But in the one case, as in the other,
the fragments are precious. And it may in such a book as the
present, be pardonable once more to point to the feather in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>cap of Criticism furnished by the fact that, but for two critics,
we should be destitute of these two great lyrics of Sappho
which, outside the contents of drama, are the crown and flower
of Greek lyrical poetry.</p>

<p class='c001'>In prose the same complete examination was only given, and,
in the special conditions so often referred to, could only have
been given, to one, and that the least important of all the divisions
of prose literature—to Oratory. Oratory is, after all, the
prose literature of the savage. It is in no degree a contradiction
to this that it should have reached its highest pitches at
periods which were not at all savage—in the palmy days of
Athens, in the agony of the Republic at Rome, in the England of
the eighteenth century—for it is scarcely necessary to take into
account the one period of modern times when savagery ruled
once more supreme, the French Revolution, though Oratory certainly
did then share the shameful throne. This confirms the
doctrine just laid down <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>simpliciter</i></span>, the others confirm it indirectly. In the great age of Greece savagery was passing; but
the efforts of civilisation were directed to making perfect what
the savage ages had regarded as most important. The whole
condition of Roman life tended to support oratory. And in
eighteenth-century England it so happened that poetry was in
abeyance; prose fiction was making its way half in the dark;
history was but just rising and philosophy, though still much
cultivated, had not got out of the strangling grasp of Locke.
Even if these propositions be disputable, the fact of the predominance
of oratory in Greece is <a id='corr203.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='not'>not,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_203.26'><ins class='correction' title='not'>not,</ins></a></span> nor is the thoroughness
(surpassing even that of the treatment of tragedy) which was
accorded to its study.</p>

<p class='c001'>Inadequate, however, as was the treatment of prose kinds in
general by the Greeks, even with such examples before them as
Plato and Thucydides and Herodotus, they <em>did</em> treat them:
and their treatment of the main critical aspects of prose was,
if not always well directed, even more searching and thorough
than their treatment of verse. They did not neglect rhythm as
it was neglected, with rare exceptions, by all modern criticism
till recently. They bestowed upon prose diction much of the
sometimes to us not fully intelligible, but constantly fruitful,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>care which they had also bestowed on the diction of poetry.
They hit at once on the great fundamental principle—that
while ordinary language breeds clearness, language of an unfamiliar
character (from whatever source that unfamiliarity
may be derived) breeds the power of <em>striking</em>—which again
not all modern critics, nor even the majority of modern critics,
seem to have been able to grasp. And then they hit upon
the Figures.</p>

<p class='c001'>A good deal of evil—too much some may think—has here
been spoken of the Figures: it will, at any rate, dispense us from
saying any more in this place, though the occasion for doing
so may recur. But the good of them as an exercise—as, in the
language of their own curious technique, a <i>progymnasma</i>—cannot
be exaggerated. Short of the merest rote-work, the consideration
of them, the realisation of what they meant, the investigations
necessary to refer to one or the other head the phrases
of the great writers, were all of them critical processes, the
defect rather than the excess of which is to be reproached upon
most modern criticism. Exclaim as we may against the practice
of ticketing a peculiarity of style as if it were an atom,
scientifically isolated, foreordained from the creation of things,
and merely gathered and applied by the writer—yet it required
at least some exercise of the pure critical spirit to separate this
atom, consider it, class it. Figure-hunting and figure-shaping
may have been aberrations of the critical spirit, but they
showed that spirit: they may have led too many to acquiesce
in mere terminology, but they showed the way to something
very different from any such acquiescence.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, finally, we turn to the results of Greek criticism as applied
to Greek authors, we come to a region necessarily of doubt, if
not exactly of dread. The preoccupations of the writers in
various directions, which have already been mentioned, and
the occasional difficulty of placing ourselves at their point
of view, make the necessary adjustments difficult, but they do
not make them hopeless.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Homeric criticism, the oldest, the largest, and in some
respects at least the most interesting department of the whole
subject, we find less difference from somewhat similarly situated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>bodies of criticism in other times than might be expected by
some—as little as might be expected by others. As with
Shakespeare, as with Dante, as with Cervantes, as with Molière,
we find a vast body of unintelligent, if respectable, plodding, and
of futile, if occasionally ingenious, crotchet and hypothesis. As
in those cases, we find the phenomenon, curious if it were not
so familiar, of a sort of personal partisanship or antipathy—two
things the most unfavourable to criticism, yet the most
frequently found in connection with it.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c008'><sup>[275]</sup></a> What we do not find,
in any satisfactory measure, is literary criticism, pure and simple.
The critics are constantly drawn away to side questions,
after a fashion which is only more excusable than similar
conduct in modern times because of the very different relations
in which Homer stood to the Greeks. We have talked (Heaven
knows!) nonsense enough about Shakespeare as it is. How
much more should we have talked if he had been at once the
oldest and greatest of our men of letters, the most ancient
literary repository of our history, and a kind of Scripture, a
religious document, as well? To the Greek Homer was all
this, and more than all this. To the student of language he
presented the oldest literary exponent of it, to the lover of
poetry the admittedly sovereign poet. But neither could bring
himself to regard him merely in these lights. The Greeks
cared less than the Romans, and very much less than most
modern nations, for personal <a id='corr205.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='genealogy'>genealogy;</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_205.25'><ins class='correction' title='genealogy'>genealogy;</ins></a></span> the personal grudge
and jealousy which is the ugliest feature of the Greek character,
but which is probably inseparable from small democratic
societies, made too strongly against this. Very rarely do we
find in Greeks any of the feeling which made Romans cherish
the notion of being descended from the fabulous companions of
Æneas, and from the perhaps not fully historical heroes of the
monarchy and the early republic—which, to this day, makes all,
save foolish fanfarons of freedom from prejudice, rejoice in the
possession, or regret the absence, of a Crusading ancestor. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>the other hand, local patriotism and local pride were as notoriously
strong in the Greek breast; and to the latest periods
we find, not merely Homer but even Herodotus, treated exclusively
as if they were stores of flattering or unflattering
particulars about the critic’s birthplace and its history. Again,
most Greeks were religious, if not quite in our way, and almost
all Greeks were interested in philosophy. With religious and
even with philosophical questions Homer had been for ages
(even at the beginning of the bulk of the literature that we
have) so intimately associated that few could disentangle themselves
from the associations. If we refuse to remember that
the questions discussed resemble rather the questions of Original
Sin, or of Innate Ideas, than those of Classic and Romantic, it
may astonish us that age after age should busy itself unweariedly
with the discussion of Homer’s moral or immoral
purpose in depicting the scenes between Helen, Paris, and
Aphrodite, between Zeus and Hera with the cestus, instead
of dilating upon the character-force of the first scene and the
voluptuous beauty of the second. But if we realise the motives
which actuated them, we shall be less surprised to find so little
literary criticism of Homer.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have far more in regard to the Tragedians, and for obvious
reasons: indeed we have more strictly literary criticism in regard
to the drama than to any other division of Greek literary art.
The estimates of the Three in general seem to have been not
very different from what we should expect, but still somewhat
different. The magnificence of Æschylus struck the scrupulous
Greek taste as too often approaching bombast, and we look
with surprised disappointment for so much as a single appreciation
of his unequalled choruses (that of Dion, noted above,
is slight and little to the point). With the Greek public generally
Euripides seems, on the whole, and putting different times
together, to have been the favourite of the three, and if the
critics were less favourable to him, it was rather for extra-literary
than for literary reasons. Public and critics together
seem to have felt for Sophocles that special esteem, as distinguished,
perhaps, from actual enthusiasm, which has descended
to us moderns as a sort of venerable convention—to be acquiesced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>in even when we do not actively share it, and to be
transformed occasionally into vehement championship. Only
from Longinus do we learn that Sophocles was considered to be
far from impeccable, but to atone for his faults by his beauties:
and Longinus himself, unfortunately, does not tell us what the
faults were.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Orators have naturally been discussed with greater
minuteness than any other group, nor have the results of
the discussion been much interfered with by modern study.
The pre-eminence of Demosthenes was as much “matter of
breviary” with Dionysius as with Longinus, with Longinus
as with Hermogenes: and if Aristotle says little about his
mighty contemporary, we know what the great ox was that trod
on his tongue. Necessarily the criticism bears largely—indeed
almost entirely—on the oratorical effect; but this effect, narrowly
studied as it was, in the hopes of, at any rate to some extent,
reproducing it, was analysed into parts which had not a little
to do with literature. And, except in Longinus himself (some
of whose best remarks are on the orators), there is no chapter
of Greek literary criticism richer than the commentaries of
Dionysius on these orators generally.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the same way, Plato seems to have early won, and easily
kept, his proper place at the head of philosophers who are
men of letters, while the more mannered graces of Isocrates
seem, at least generally, to have been put in their proper
position. That so obvious, and at the same time so complicated
and tempting, a contrast as that of the historical manners
of Thucydides and Herodotus should escape quickwitted
students was of course impossible; but here those drawbacks,
to which reference has been made above, are specially apparent.
The animus of Dionysius against the one is as patent, though
not quite so stupid, as that of Plutarch or the pseudo-Plutarch
against the other; and on the whole the ancient critics seem to
have stuck, with surprising want of energy and acuteness, in
the commonplace contrast of the instructive and the amusing,
instead of going on to the far more interesting contrast of strict
literary manner which the two authors offer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the other kinds we have much more scattered and less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>satisfactory observations. The Greeks were clearly not happy
with their Comedy; they were half ashamed of Aristophanes,
who might suffice for the glory of a whole literature; and they
seem to have too often ranked the ingenious and fertile, but
distinctly thin and “pretty,” talent of Menander above his.
The same curious kind of mistaken belittling would appear
to have hung upon Lyric. Both upon these and several
other kinds, from Dithyramb to Mimiambics, they remind us
of the apologetic remarks of our own eighteenth-century
censors on the work of their own time, which, from the point
of view of universal literature, will last longest and rank
highest—fiction, essay, and the like. In fact, this mistaken
calculus of appraisement of kinds is one of the main notes
of the whole subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>The punishment, as usual, has been adjusted to the crime;
and the merit, as usual also, has met with its reward from the
secure judgment of the world. The more a man knows Greek
literature the more deeply will he be impressed with the
inestimable services which, in criticism as elsewhere, the Greeks
rendered to humanity. But the more he knows other literatures,
besides Greek, the more will he be convinced of the
necessity of enlarging, extending, and at the same time correcting,
the Greek point of critical view.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>The conditions of Latin criticism.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Those who direct their literary ideas by considerations of what
they think likely to happen, or of what they think ought to
have happened, would probably expect—neither
without some reason nor without a certain amount
of confirmation from experience—a considerable
development of literary criticism under the Latin dispensation.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c008'><sup>[276]</sup></a>
In the first place, the Romans had what the Greeks
at first lacked, and afterwards too often disdained, that opportunity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>of Comparison, which, as has been said so often, is the
very life and soul and breath of the higher and better critical
exercise. In the second place, the whole literature of their
classical period was itself a kind of critical imitation—sometimes
pretty slavish, sometimes freer—of Greek: and it was
practically impossible for a Roman to write without the
exercise, independent or second-hand, of processes of study
and thought which were critical or nothing. Against this
must be set the facts—first, that the Latin literary genius was
somewhat timid, that it felt itself rebuked by the majesty of
Greece; and secondly, that the tendency of the race was not,
till it was much mixed with others, very decidedly literary.
Few Romans dared to approach the masterpieces of Greek
literary art in a thoroughly critical spirit, and fewer had the
sense of literature which might have enabled them to do so
usefully. Further, their own period of consummate production
was distinctly short, and not excessively fruitful, while
those authors of their own to whom they devoted most attention
stimulated only certain kinds of criticism. Virgil and
Cicero are very great writers, doubtless, but everybody does
not feel much enthusiasm for the first, and some people do
not feel much enthusiasm for the second. The curious perfection
of Horace is, after all, as limited as it is curious—there
are no vistas in it; and the same may be said of the
easy flow of Livy, the artificial, and, for its range, intense
idiosyncrasy of Sallust, and the artful fancy of Ovid. These
six writers seem to have always attracted the lion’s share of
Roman admiration, though at one time there might be a taste
for the tricks, precious or slightly obscure, of Seneca in prose
and Persius in verse, at another for other things. For their
two most poetical poets, Lucretius and Catullus, the Romans
never seem to have felt any deep or widespread admiration;
their proseman of greatest genius, Tacitus, came too late, and
was too unpopular in his sentiments, to attract much. Even
so late as the latter days of Quintilian, when the Silver Age
itself was drawing to a close, we find that it was customary
to devote chief attention to Greek, and that it was thought
necessary to argue for Latin as for a novice, who, if well trained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>and encouraged, might become a pretty fighter in time. As for
Cicero’s time, there is no reason to suppose him an exception:
yet we know how, when not in full public dress, he takes
refuge in Greek at every moment, and sometimes seems almost
inclined to echo a phrase of Ascham’s in the dawn of modern
English letters, and say it would be “more easier” for him
to write in Greek, as it was for the author of the <cite>Toxophilus</cite>
to have written in Latin.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is, however, from Cicero that Roman literary criticism,
properly so called, begins,<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c008'><sup>[277]</sup></a> and he, with Horace, almost exhausts
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Cicero.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
our supply of it from the days before the Empire.
Yet he prepares us for the disappointments which
meet us in Latin criticism even more than in Greek. That
Cicero’s interest in literature was great no one would dream
of denying. His letters swarm with quotations and literary
allusion; he is constantly arranging for new bookcases and
new books; he no sooner has enforced (he never had much
voluntary) leisure than he sets to work to write, to translate,
to compose, to discuss. But the general inconveniences just
noted, and some others of a particular nature, prevent him
from being of much importance as a critic. He thought
himself (as Quintilian later thought him) a philosopher, and
he devoted much time to composing agreeable but extremely
diluted copies of the Platonic dialogues. He was an orator
not merely by profession but by taste, and he has left us
(even excluding the pretty certainly spurious <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ad Herennium</cite></span>)
a very respectable bulk of Rhetorical work. But, as we shall
presently see more in detail, most of this belongs altogether
to the non-literary side of Rhetoric. Still, in default of some
regular treatise (which was hardly to be expected), it is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>his abundant, varied, and interesting correspondence that we
should look for material, and we find very little of it. Here
is a joke on the habit of Aristarchus (and indeed of other
critics), the habit of marking as spurious anything they do
not like: there an equally jocular introduction of rhetorical
technicalities; elsewhere a rather curious but more linguistic
than literary disquisition on the way in which innocent words
and phrases acquire, half by accident, awkward double meanings,
or slip into the single bad meaning only. There is a
passage of some interest in a letter to Atticus about Cicero’s
lost Greek history of his consulship, where he describes himself
as having used up all Isocrates' perfume-shop, and the
cabinets of his disciples, and even Aristotelian pigments.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c008'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But the most direct and famous piece of pure literary criticism
in the letters is an unlucky one. Cicero of course came
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His attitude to Lucretius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
before—or rather himself led—the most brilliant
age of Latin, and could not have so much as seen
the work of Virgil, of Horace, much less of Ovid, and others.
But he could and he did know Lucretius, whose work an
absurd tradition has it that he even revised. And what does
he say of this mighty poet, who unites the poignancy of
Catullus to the sustained grasp of Virgil, and adds a sublimity
unknown to both? The manuscripts are said to read: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Lucretii
poemata, ut scribis, ita sunt: multis luminibus ingenii multæ
tamen artis</i></span>.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c008'><sup>[279]</sup></a> The earlier editors most naturally considered
this sentence nonsense. No doubt the opposition of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ingenium</i></span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ars</i></span> is a common thing, almost a commonplace, in Latin.
But would any one, unless he had a thesis to prove, dream of
regarding <i>tamen</i> as admissible here? of translating it as if it
were <i>necnon</i>? There is, of course, a certain paradoxical sense
in which, at the end of the nineteenth century, a brisk young
critic might say of Mr X., “He has plenty of brains, <em>and yet</em>
he really knows how to write.” But this is not in the least
Roman; and it is Ciceronian rather less than it is Roman
generally. Some, recognising that there must have been a <i>non</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>somewhere, put it before <i>multæ</i>, and suppose that Cicero, as
if he had been accustomed to Virgilian smoothness, thought
Lucretius rough. But this, from his own verses, is very <a id='corr215.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='unlikely'>unlikely.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_215.3'><ins class='correction' title='unlikely'>unlikely.</ins></a></span>
The natural emendation is to put the <i>non</i> (as till
recently it used always to be supplied) before <i>multis</i>, which
emendation, and which alone, makes the sentence run as,
without prejudice on the score of the special meaning, we
should expect it to run: “The poems of Lucretius are, as
you say, not very full of brilliancy in genius, but show plenty
of art.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Supposing this to be so, some have tried to make out that
Cicero’s well-known dislike of the Epicurean tenets accounts
for the unfavourable criticism. So much the worse for him
as a literary critic if it was so. A man who cannot taste
Shelley because Shelley attacks Christianity, or laugh at the
<cite>Twopenny Postbag</cite> because Moore was a Whig, may be, and
very likely is, an honour to his species as a man, but the
less said about him as a critic of literature the better. But
there is no real probability of such a plea having any foundation.
We shall see what Quintilian says about Lucretius
later: we know that very few other Latin writers say anything
about him at all. Cicero, who would fain have been a poet,
and who sometimes could hammer out a tolerable hexameter,<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c008'><sup>[280]</sup></a>
could not as a mere craftsman, as a mere student of Rhetoric,
fail to appreciate something of the “art” of Lucretius. The
stately volume of those magnificent hexameters—the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ne plus
ultra</i></span> of their kind in more ways than one or two—could
not but appeal to him as a mere connoisseur of Latin rhythm,
which (put him high or low in general literature) he most
certainly was. The difference in comparison with Ennius, as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>matter of art, was for such a man as Cicero simply unmistakable.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the qualities of the Lucretian “genius,” as distinguished
from the Lucretian art, were not suited to attract Cicero—were,
we may say, without fear of injustice, suited to attract very few
Romans of the true type.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c008'><sup>[281]</sup></a> That type was, as far as the defects
went, distinctly “barbarian,” in the sense in which Mr Matthew
Arnold (very unjustly) applied the word to the English aristocracy—full
of vigour, instinct with the faculty of ruling,
magnanimous after a fashion, but impenetrable to ideas, only
formally religious, shutting off its keen perception of a certain
justice with huge blinkers, and, above all, curiously insensible
to the vague, the mystical, the sense of wonder. Now, Lucretius,
though he had chosen for himself a creed approaching
mere materialism, had treated it in a fashion constantly and
unabashedly ideal. It does not need the “flaming bastions of
the world” or the sense of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>néant</i></span>, splendidly as he can describe
both, to awake the poetical faculty in him. He can
make poetry out of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>exiguum clinamen</i></span>, and out of things less
promising if even more abstract still. With him it is always
“the riding that does it”; the subject hardly matters at all.
Lucretius, in short, was one of the great poets—sheerly and
merely as poets—of the world. The didactics in which our
eighteenth-century versemen so dismally failed offer no more
difficulties to him than a love-poem or a flowery description.
He will do you a science, or an atomic system, as another might
do an Odyssey or a story of Lancelot. Now this was what the
ancients, with all their acuteness and originality, could seldom
understand or like; and what Cicero (a man of genius in some
ways, but something of a Philistine and nothing of a poet)
could like least of all those who can in any way be compared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>with him. Many of the beauties of the Lucretian imagination
would be no doubt simply lost on him; and others he
would consider wasted on the wrong subjects, if not positively
applied in the wrong manner. Let us, however, for
fairness' sake, accept the MS. reading, allow that <i>tamen</i> may
be the same or nearly the same as <i>necnon</i>, and further allow
that as Marcus is only echoing words of Quintus which we
do not possess, equity would in any case require that we
should lay no very great stress on his own. There will still
remain the objection that a poem of this character and importance,
brought directly under his notice, and already as is
clear within his knowledge, does not tempt him to do anything
more than echo his correspondent’s words in a cut-and-dried
formula which would be applicable to any tolerably good composition
in verse, and which does not touch nor approach the
idiosyncrasy of the poem itself. We cannot therefore very
greatly regret that we have so little pure literary criticism
from him. But still we must, for the sake of completeness,
give some account of his Rhetorical works, which, in a manner,
play the same complementary part to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ars Poetica</cite></span> of Horace
that the twin treatises of the Stagirite play to each other.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, however, no small difference between the values of
the Rhetorical works themselves. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ad Herennium</cite></span>, even if
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Rhetorical works.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
it were as certainly Cicero’s as it is almost certainly
not his, would require very small attention, for it is
a strict <i>Techne</i> or Art of Rhetoric, of the kind which
we have thoroughly examined in the First Book, rigidly limited
to Oratory, and containing nothing that may not be found in
a dozen or a hundred other places. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Inventione</cite></span>—more
probably, if still not certainly, Cicero’s—is equally technical,
and has hardly anything of interest for us except a quotation
from Curio, which gives the lie direct to the “saw” of our
“dead shepherd,”<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c008'><sup>[282]</sup></a> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Nemo potest uno aspectu neque præteriens in
amorem incidere</i></span>. It is to Cicero’s credit that he cites this as
a rhetorical assumption, as saying that what happens rarely
does not happen at all. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Oratore</cite></span> looks more promising,
especially as there are references, in its very <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>exordia</i></span>, to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>study of letters and its difficulty. There is a passage of some
interest in Book II., cap. 12, 13, on the connection of oratory
and history, with a short review of the Greek historians; and
another of somewhat wider reference in cap. 7 of Book III.,
besides, it may be, others still here and there, especially that
which begins about the 37th chapter of the third book. The
<cite>Brutus</cite> is the best of all, with its survey of the Latin orators
and its account of the author’s literary education. The <cite>Orator</cite>
deals still more closely with oratorical style, as does the little
tract, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Optimo Genere Oratorum</cite></span>. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Partitiones</cite></span> and the
<cite>Topica</cite> are again mainly, if not even merely, technical.</p>

<p class='c001'>It will be seen from this, not only that there is little purely
literary criticism in Cicero, but that it is rather unjust to expect
any from him. It was not his business; he had hardly any
examples of it before him (and Cicero, like most other Latins,
was a man who could do little without a pattern); the mere
subject-matter (at least as far as Latin was concerned) was far
from very abundant or specially interesting. Moreover, he was
constantly occupied on other things. We know, from passages
cited above, and others, that he had the purely grammatical
and lexicographical interest which was so strong in the Romans;
he must have had real feeling for poetry, or he would not be
so constantly quoting it, nor would he have made his unequal
attempts at writing it; he would fain, in the same way, have been
a historian. But these were mere pastimes; and both from that
vanity which was his master passion, and from an honest conviction
which, as we have seen, was widely spread in antiquity,
he seems to have thought Oratory the roof and crown of
things literary, the queen of literary kinds, to which all
others were ancillary, pedagogic, mere exercising-grounds and
sources of convenient ornament. No one so thinking could
make any great proficiency in literary criticism, and Cicero
did not make any such.</p>

<p class='c001'>This estimate of Cicero may seem audaciously unfair, if
not grossly incompetent, to those who accept the more usual
one. So far as much, if not all, very high authority goes,
I must acknowledge, though I do not recant, my heresy. Mr
Nettleship, for instance, while acknowledging that Cicero
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“threw his whole strength into the criticism of oratorical
prose,” still speaks of his work, especially of the <cite>Brutus</cite>, with
something like enthusiasm, claims “genius” and “fulness of
light” for him, and even makes what is to me, I confess, the
astonishing remark that he “follows in the same track as the
Greek critics in all probability had done before him, as undoubtedly
Dionysius <em>and the author of the</em> Περὶ Ὕψους did after
him.” I should have myself thought that if there were two
critics who might be pedantically symbolised as A and not-A,
they were Cicero and Longinus. But to give the other side, in
the case of so important a client with such an admirable advocate,
I may say that Mr Nettleship, while admitting Cicero’s
tendency to the wooden placing and comparison borrowed from
the Greeks, and naturally made more wooden by the Latins,
and granting his inadequacy as to History (which he, like
so many others whom we have seen and shall see, regards
as a mere <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ancilla</i></span> of Oratory), claims for him the origination of
the principle that the general as well as the connoisseurs must
stamp the value of a work (<cite>Brutus</cite>, 183), approves his distaste
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Oratore</cite></span>, iii. 96) for “precious” style, and gives a most
interesting <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cento</i></span> from the <cite>Brutus</cite> (93, <a href='#Page_125'>125</a>, <a href='#Page_139'>139</a>, <a href='#Page_143'>143</a>, <a href='#Page_148'>148</a>, <a href='#Page_201'>201</a>,
261, <a href='#Page_274'>274</a>, 301). In these characterisations of the great orators
he finds qualities of the highest kind, completing the panegyric
by saying, “His usual prolixity is thrown aside, and he returns
to obey the true laws of expression. As a critic he can write
with all Tacitus' terseness and without any of Tacitus' affectation.”
I quote, though—and indeed because—I cannot agree.</p>

<p class='c001'>One point of great interest, however, in which there may be
general agreement as to Cicero’s achievement, Mr Nettleship
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His Critical Vocabulary.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
did not treat in his Essay, though a passage therein
leads straight to it. This passage gives a very useful
list<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c008'><sup>[283]</sup></a> (elsewhere referred to) of some of the technical terms
of criticism which appear to have accumulated in Greek literature
during the post-Aristotelian period. Some of these are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>either used in their ordinary sense, or in senses easily and
closely tropical; others are more far-fetched, and, as has also
been noted elsewhere, remind one of the technicalities of wine-tasting
(especially in French), or of pictorial art. Some are
very hard to render exactly in other languages.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has always been noticed that Cicero—a master of language,
and though far from the pedantic prejudice which
then tabooed Greek words in Latin, just as it now taboos
French words in English, always anxious to enrich his own
tongue when he could—has shown special ingenuity in translating,
paraphrasing, and adding to this rhetorical and critical
dictionary. It is not, however, very many years since the
interesting labour of a French scholar<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c008'><sup>[284]</sup></a> made it possible, without
very considerable trouble on one’s own part, to get the
results of this process ready for study. With the Ciceronian
terms of mere forensic Rhetoric (though all students of the
Greek and Latin Rhetoricians will agree with M. Causeret that
these terms have been, with a very mischievous result, transferred
to other branches) we need not busy ourselves. It is
under the usual head of “Elocution” that we shall find most
to interest us. The abundance of the Ciceronian vocabulary
every one will recognise; it is less certain whether we are
to admire its precision. But it is at least an innocent, and
may sometimes be a profitable, pleasure to classify the usages
of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inusitatum</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>insolens</i></span>, to separate the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>nuances</i></span> of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>obsoletum</i></span>,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>priscum</i></span>, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vetustum</i></span>, of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>grandia</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gravia</i></span>, of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>majestas</i></span> and
<em>splendor</em>. The Latin rather than the Teutonic languages admit
the distinctions of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>juncta</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cohærentia</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>apta</i></span>, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>coagmentata</i></span>, if
distinction there be; but it would be of real value to ascertain
whether there was any between <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>modus</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>numerus</i></span>. Sometimes
at least it seems as if it might coincide with that
between “rhythm” and “metre”: while often <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>numerus</i></span> itself
seems to be “rhythm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>By no means uninteresting, again, are the numerous metaphorical
expressions from actual physiology—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lacerti</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sanguis</i></span>,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nervi</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>succus</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>exsanguis</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>enervatus</i></span>—which we find applied to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>style, and the still more numerous but vaguer terms, most of
them with modern equivalents, which express its qualities by
comparison with moral ones.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is impossible not to see what an influence the use of
such terms by such an author must have had, and we shall
find evidences much later (in Pliny, for instance) that the
language of literary criticism at Rome yielded in nothing to
that beautiful dialect which enables our own censors to speak
of a novel as “assertive and challenging,” of the “swiftness
and fusion” of its style. But whether the influence was as
beneficial as it was great is perhaps rather a different question.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c008'><sup>[285]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The contrast between the limited and partial relevance of
Aristotle’s <cite>Rhetoric</cite> to literary criticism, and the complete if
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Horace.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
still limited relevance of his <cite>Poetics</cite>, is repeated
far more pointedly in that between the Rhetorical
works of Cicero and the so-called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ars Poetica</cite></span> of Horace. It
is, in fact—though the most ardent admirers of the Venusian
would fain defend it from being intentionally and originally
an Art of Poetry at all—the most complete, nay, the only
complete, example of literary criticism that we have from
any Roman.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c008'><sup>[286]</sup></a> As in other similar cases, before saying much
about it in the way of secondary comment, it will be well to
give a fairly full analysis of it, which can be the better done
because of its extreme shortness. The famous tags with which
it abounds, to an extent almost unmatched, may be sometimes,
but need not be always, given in full.</p>

<p class='c001'>In form it is merely an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epistola ad Pisones</cite></span>, and plunges at
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Ad Pisones.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
once into its subject, without any attempt at preliminary
argument or flourish.</p>

<p class='c001'>The representations of art, like the presentations of nature,
must be characterised by appropriateness of parts; you must
not simply join anything to anything else. Perhaps, says an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>objector; but surely painters and poets enjoy liberty of fancy.
Certainly; but still some propriety must be observed. Even
ornament must be adjusted to the subject; and even when
correctness itself is specially attempted, defects wait on the
attempt—obscurity on brevity, bombast on flights, tameness
on simplicity. Take care that your subject suits both your
style and your powers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, as to vocabulary? There is no reason why old words
should not be resuscitated and new ones coined, provided that
both things are done “with brains” and discretion. Usage
is the arbiter, and what usage will not admit must be content
to perish. As for metre, the kinds appropriate to the various
subjects have been long ago settled, though by whom is not
always known—hexameters for Epic by Homer, elegiacs for
less important matter by somebody or other, iambics for satire
by Archilochus, and so on with tragedy, comedy, lyric, and
the rest. It is not wise to alter this established order.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the same way, the established styles and characters must
be maintained: a tragic hero must not speak like a comic one,
or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>; and you must not attempt new lights on the
character of accepted heroes and heroines like Achilles and
Odysseus and Medea. At the same time, you need not cling
to the stock subjects, and if you take quite novel ones you
may handle your character as you like, provided it keep
uniformity throughout. But you may be wiser if you stick
to the old.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c008'><sup>[287]</sup></a> If you do, do not begin too magniloquently;
bustle your reader well along in the action; and drop the
ungrateful parts of the story.</p>

<p class='c001'>As before for traditional characters, so for the stock parts.
Generalise and conventionalise wisely; let your boys be childish;
your youths fond of sport, reckless, and fickle; your men
of full age, business-like and prudent; your old men praisers
of the past, sluggish, grudging, and so forth. In short—Keep
to the Type.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>In play-writing be careful how you utilise the double opportunity
of representation and narrative. Do not let ugly things
appear on the actual stage. Stick to your five acts; do not be
prodigal of your <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>deus ex machina</i></span>; do not introduce a fourth
personage. Keep your chorus to its business—moral sentiment,
religious tone, and so forth. This caution introduces a long
digression on the incursion of elaborate music into the stage,
and on the combination (while keeping them <em>unmixed</em>) of
Satiric Drama and Tragedy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, with the almost shorthand abruptness of transition
which characterises the poem, we pass to an incidental consideration
of metres. An iambic is a long syllable put after a short
one, and you arrange them in batches of six with, in certain
places only, spondees for a change. Do not take too many
licences: stick to the Greek. If your ancestors were fools
enough to admire Plautus you need not. They say Thespis
invented drama, or at least tragedy. Æschylus improved it
and made it magniloquent. Then came the Old Comedy—rather
too licentious, so that it had to pull in its sails and drop its
chorus. We have tried all sorts, not without success, but the
labour of the file is absolutely necessary. The idea of poetic
madness and excess is all nonsense. If I cannot write great
poetry I can teach others how to write it. Be careful of your
subject, and do not attend to tuneful trifles.</p>

<p class='c001'>You must either instruct or delight, or both; you must not
write romantic and prodigious extravagances. Mix pleasure
with profit and you are safe. You need not be absolutely faultless,
but avoid faults as much as you can. Be careful to suit
the style to the subject as much as possible, and do not “pad.”
Mediocre poetry is intolerable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally, do not be in a hurry to publish; invite friendly
criticism; do not force yourself; destroy a good deal. For
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nescit vox missa reverti</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The influence of poets is mythically signified by the stories
of Orpheus, who moved beasts, and Amphion, who built Thebes
by song. Homer came next, and was famous. Tyrtæus roused
men to war. Many kinds of poetry have been discovered since,
and they all need hard work to cultivate them with success.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Some remarks on recitation follow, and then the lines on which
friendly criticism should proceed are drawn, and the piece ends
rather ambiguously with a reference to the fate of Empedocles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, in criticising this criticism we must of course take into
consideration the plea that Horace may not have meant to give
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its desultoriness</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
a regular treatise even on Dramatic Poetry, but
merely to throw out a few observations for the
benefit of a friend. It is still more obvious that we must not
saddle him with all the rubbish of corollary and comment with
which he has been loaded (sometimes without his having in
the least deserved or provoked it) by the “Classical” critics
of the 16th-18th centuries. Yet not merely equitable but
generous allowances of this kind will still leave the piece open
to pretty severe comment. In the first place, its desultoriness
is excessive, even extravagant. Much licence in this respect
no doubt must be allowed to the “mixer of the useful and the
pleasant” by means of verse-didactics. But no possible licence
will cover Horace’s method, or absence of method. He begins
with a sufficiently lively diatribe against inconsistency of
design and want of harmony of parts, then slides to methods
of composition, thence to vocabulary, thence to the technical
divisions of prosody, thence to stock characters and the selection
of subject, gives cautions as to the minor and more arbitrary
proprieties of the stage, indulges in a little bit of literary history,
returns to metres, insists on the importance of self- and
other criticism. Then he shifts artfully to the contrast between
Greek emulation and Roman shopkeeping covetousness, extols
Orpheus and Amphion, Homer and Tyrtæus, excuses faults
if they are not too many, but will not tolerate mere even
mediocrity, cautions against flattering hearers, and ends with
a description, half sarcastic, half rallying the sarcasm, of bad
poets. If it were not for its vividness and its constellation of
glittering phrases, nobody could see in such a thing aught but
a mere congeries of desultory observations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still more indisputable is the singular spirit of routine—of
red-tape—which pervades the piece. Aristotle (whom Horace
follows without direct acknowledgment, and by no means slavishly,
but still on the whole) had been sufficiently positive, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>not seldom a little arbitrary; but he had carefully abstained
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and arbitrary conventionality.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
from mere red-tape. Horace, in his prescription of
the five acts, and his proscription of the fourth actor,
measures that tape off in a fashion which implies
one of two things, both of them bad—either implicit belief in
purely arbitrary rules, or indifference to the mischief that such
rules may do. Elsewhere, though his good sense sometimes
interferes to advantage, he is, though less meticulously, as
slavishly conventional. You must use the consecrated metres,
and no others, for the various subjects; you must keep to the
accepted lineaments of well-known characters, and you must
model your new ones strictly on types. Decency, propriety,
convention—to these things you must look throughout. If
you are really a great poet you may be allowed a “fault” or
two, as a great beauty is allowed a mole, but still it is a “fault.”
And so this kind of pottering and peddling censorship goes on
through the whole. We are at such an antithesis or antipodes
to the Περὶ Ὕψους, that one sometimes feels inclined to give
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ars Poetica</cite></span> a third title and call it Περὶ μεσότητος, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De
Mediocritate</cite></span>, so directly does it tend to produce the quality
which, in one of its own happier moments, it denounces.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this, I say, is undeniable, or, if it be denied, the denial is
of no consequence. But the compensatory merits are very considerable.
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its compensations: Brilliancy.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In the first place, it is no small thing to
have got once more to purely, or almost purely,
literary criticism, to have done with the sense that
literature as such is only the second thought, the <i>parergon</i>, at
best the mere means, not the end, to the critic. In the second
place, it is a greater thing still to have our literary criticism,
now that we have got it, done by such a man as Horace, one in
whom the generation of the critic has not waited for the corruption
of the poet,<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c008'><sup>[288]</sup></a> and who has the peculiar gift of crisp rememberable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>felicitous phrase. The few hundred lines of the little
piece are positively “made of quotations.” Every man of
letters, at least, ought to have learnt it by heart in the original
during his youth. Yet even to those who have not been thus
favoured, but who have some tincture of Humanity, mere scraps
and tags of it must often recall the actual context, or at least
the sense. The first five-and-twenty lines contain, in the way
of such “lights” of phrase, at least seven:—</p>

<p class='c019'>And the proportion is well maintained throughout.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the greatest value of the piece, beyond all doubt, is
the clear and distinct idea which it gives of one, and that
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Typical spirit</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the  principal, side of the critical conception of
literature in Roman times certainly, in all times
more or less. Just as, and in the same manner as, we said
that Longinus plays the exception among the critics of antiquity,
so does Horace represent the rule. There is indeed
something in other critics of antiquity of the spirit which
makes Longinus pre-eminent, but it is not prominent in them.
There is in the better of them, especially in Aristotle, much
that is not in Horace; but what they have in common with
him is the differentia of them all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of this latter spirit those worse points which we have
noted in the piece are the caricature or corruption, the others
are the rational embodiment and expression. “Observe order;
do not grovel or soar too high; stick to the usage of reasonable
and well-bred persons; be neither stupid nor shocking; above
all, be like the best of your predecessors, stick to the norm
of the class, do not attempt a perhaps impossible and certainly
dangerous individuality.” In short the false <i>mimesis</i>—imitation
of previous art—is mixing herself up more and more with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>true <i>mimesis</i>, representation of nature. If it is not exactly
true that, as a modern prose Horace has it, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Tout est dit</i></span>, at
any rate the forms in which everything ought to be said have
long been found out. You cannot improve on them: try to
make the best use of them that you can.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is needless to say with what hardly matched and certainly
unsurpassed shrewdness and neatness Horace has—not merely
in the tags, the phrases, the purple patches themselves
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and practical value.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
noted above, but throughout—set forth, enforced,
decorated his views. Except in a few
extremest moods, when the whole world of literature seems
to be at once painted red and strangled with the tape that
paints it, he is never absurd; he is never even negligible.
The most “dishevelled” Romantic may neglect him, but the
neglect will always be at his own peril—he must be a Shakespeare,
or at least a Marlowe, a Shelley, or at least a Beddoes,
if he flies in the face of the Horatian precepts. These precepts
even, in the opening, in the “mediocrity” remark, in the
peroration and elsewhere, contain not a little antidote for
their own bane. “Not worth writing” would be the Horatian
verdict on many a “Classical” poem which the judge might
acknowledge to be quite unobjectionably written; while on
the other hand the evils of extravagance, of disproportion, of
tedious and silly crotchet and caprice, at which he drives
full from first to last, are real evils, and by no means to be
minimised. It is not rash to say—though perhaps one must
have read more literatures, and passed through more phases
of literary judgment than one, before saying it with conviction—that
there is no school or period of literary practice in which
the precepts of Horace, when rightly taken, have lost, or are
ever likely to lose, critical validity. To say this is to say
a very great deal. But it is not inconsistent with—and it
makes especially necessary—the further observation that the
critical attitude of Horace is a wofully incomplete one. In
the first place, he has left us no really “grasping” judgment
of a single writer he has mentioned. He had not much
room, but nobody could put a paragraph in a line better than
he could, when he understood and cared for the matter. Horace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>on Orpheus and Amphion, on Homer, nay, on Æschylus and
Plautus, is <em>banal</em>—badly <em>banal</em>, one may add. But let us
grant that the knack of luminous summarising of the individual
was not, and could not be, yet born, was not even
with Longinus, was not even fifteen hundred years after
Horace. His shortcomings do not cease here. Here as elsewhere,
except in a few passages of the graver philosophy of
life, there is no “soul” in him. He has no enthusiasm, no
passion. It is perhaps improper to bring together Horace
and Mr Browning, but I never read the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epistola ad Pisones</cite></span>
without thinking of certain lines of the latter:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The fool! would he try a flight further and say,</div>
      <div class='line'>He never saw, never, before to-day,</div>
      <div class='line'>What was able to take his breath away—</div>
      <div class='line'>A face to lose youth for, to occupy age</div>
      <div class='line'>With the dream of, meet death with—why, I'll not engage</div>
      <div class='line'>But that, half in a rapture and half in a rage,</div>
      <div class='line'>I should toss him the thing’s self, ‘’Tis only a duplicate,</div>
      <div class='line'>A thing of no value—take it, I supplicate.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Longinus, one feels, would have been in some danger of losing
his literary loves on this principle; the modern critic can “say
ditto to Mr Browning” over a thousand passages. But Horace
was quite safe. He never felt this enthusiasm for author,
or book, or page; and so he never tried, as others in their
despairing way do, to render a reason for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>To those who consider criticism as a whole and historically,
the enormous influence which the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ars Poetica</cite></span> has exercised
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Satires <i>and</i> Epistles.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
must always give it the prerogative place among
its author’s critical work. But it is needless to
say that he has other claims to appear here. And the pieces
which give him these claims have by some been considered
more important, as they certainly are more original. It is
unnecessary to pick out <i>Pindarum quisquis</i> and the other
literary references in the Odes, universally known, admirably
expressed, but as criticism hardly more than a refashioning of
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>publica materies</i></span>. The Fourth and Sixth <cite>Satires</cite> of the First
book, which are probably a good deal earlier than the adaptation
from Neoptolemus, and the two <cite>Epistles</cite> of the Second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>book, which may be taken as later, are serious documents. The
Satires perhaps give a better opinion of Horace’s talent than of
his taste and temper. His critics had praised Lucilius against
him; and without denying his predecessor all merit, he makes,
though less generously, the sort of comment which even Dryden
made on the rough versification and lack of art of the giant
race before the flood. This (i. 4) naturally brought fresh
attacks on him, and in i. 10 he returns to the subject, lashes
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fautores ineptos Lucili</i></span>, indulges in the too famous sneer
at Catullus and Calvus, and with a touch of something which
is perhaps not quite alien from snobbishness, boasts his intimacy
and agreement not merely with Varius, Virgil, Pollio, Messala,
among men of letters, but with Mæcenas and Octavius.</p>

<p class='c001'>His general position here is easy enough to perceive, and
there are of course defences for it. Among all our thousand
fragments of Lucilius,<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c008'><sup>[289]</sup></a> but two or three at most are long
enough to give us any idea of his faculty of sustained composition.
And fine as is the fragment to Albinus—with its
Elizabethan reiteration of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>virtus</i></span> at the beginning of the lines,
its straight-hitting sense, and the positive nobility of its ethic—numerous
as are the instances in the smaller scraps of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Romana
simplicitas</i></span> and picturesque phrase, there is no doubt that the
whole is rough and unfinished, not with the roughness of one
who uses a rudimentary art, but of one who has not mastered—perhaps,
as Horace insinuates, has not taken the trouble to
master—one ready to his hand. But there is something of the
Frenchman’s “<em>We</em> are all princes or poets” about the tone of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Horace himself. He is, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mutatis mutandis</i></span>, too much in the mood
of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>parvenu</i></span> who has just been admitted to an exclusive club,
and thinks very meanly of poor wretches who are not entitled
to use the club-paper.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, Mr Nettleship is surely justified in calling
the Epistles of the second book “the best of Horace’s critical
utterances,” though perhaps they are not the most important.
Indeed, their eulogist hastens to add that “it is the incomparable
manner of the writer, the ease and sureness of his
tread,” which really interests the reader. It is so; but there is
more in criticism than manner, and you must be right as well
as felicitous. Horace is not exactly wrong, but he is limited—the
Chrysostom of Correctness has acquired better breeding
than he showed in the Satires, but he has not enlarged his view.
The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>horridus Saturnius</i></span> still strikes its own horror into him:
he still girds at the ancients; and though in the epistle to
Julius Florus there is some pleasant self-raillery, as well as
an admirable picture of the legitimate poet, yet there is
perhaps no piece of Horace which brings more clearly home
to us the fact that he was after all, as he has been called, far
more a critic of life than of literature, and much more seriously
interested in the former than in the latter. So much the
better for him perhaps; so much the better for all the
ancients who more or less agreed with him. But that is a
matter of argument: the fact remains.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c008'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The third representative selected for Roman criticism of the
latest Republic and earliest empire, the elder Seneca—"Seneca
Rhetor"—is again of a different class and at a different standpoint,
though he is very much nearer to Cicero than to Horace.</p>

<p class='c001'>The declamations of antiquity had an influence on its prose
style—and consequently an effect on its critical opinions of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Declamations.</i>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
style both in verse and prose—which it is almost
impossible to exaggerate. The  practice of them
began in boyhood; it formed almost the greater part of the
higher education; and it appears to have been continued in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>later life not merely by going to the Schools to hear novices,
but in actual practice, half exercise, half amusement, by orators
and statesmen of the most established fame. It was a sort of
mental fencing-school or gymnasium, to which those who wished
to keep their powers in training resorted, even to the close of
life. We know that Cicero composed, if he did not actually
deliver, declamations up to the very end of his career; and,
in a very different department of letters, we know from Seneca
himself that Ovid, though not a constant, was a by no means
infrequent, attendant of the schools, and either acquired or
exercised his well-known fancy for turns and plays of words
in prose as well as in verse.</p>

<p class='c001'>In theory, and no doubt to some extent in practice also,
these <i>meletæ</i>, or declamations, were permissible and desirable in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their subjects: epideictic</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
all the branches of Rhetoric. But the examples
which have come down to us, and the references that
we possess to others, show us that, as, indeed, we
should expect, Epideictic and Dicanic provided the chief
subjects. The declamations of the former kind were those
at which the satirists chiefly laughed—Hannibal crossing the
Alps, Leonidas at Thermopylæ, Whether Cicero could decently
have avoided death by making a bargain with Antony, and the
like. To this kind of subject there could evidently be no limit,
and it might sometimes pass, as in the Orations (which are after
all only declamations) of Dion Chrysostom we know that it at
least once did pass, into a regular literary Essay. But it seems
more generally to have affected the fanciful-historic.</p>

<p class='c001'>The purely forensic declamation had some differences. As
its object was not merely or mainly, like that of the other, to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and forensic.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
display cleverness, but to assist the acquisition and
display of ability as a counsel, it fell into certain
rather narrow and not very numerous grooves. Certain “hard
cases,” paradoxes of the law, seem from very early times to have
been excogitated by the ingenuity of the rhetoricians, and the
game was to treat these—on one side or the other, or both—with
as much force, but above all with as much apparent
novelty, as the speaker’s wits could manage. A very favourite
one was based on the venerable practice of allowing the victim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>of a rape the choice of death for her violator or requiring
him to marry her, with the <i>aporia</i>, “Suppose a man is guilty
of two such crimes, and one girl demands death, the other
marriage, what is to be done?” Or “Suppose a girl, situated
like Marina in <cite>Pericles</cite>, but slaying her Lysimachus, not converting
him. Released from her bondage, she presents herself
as candidate for a priestess-ship. Is she eligible or not?”<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c008'><sup>[291]</sup></a> The
extremity of perverse fancy in this direction is perhaps reached
by a pair of the declamations attributed to Quintilian,<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c008'><sup>[292]</sup></a> in which
the lover of a courtesan brings an action against her for
administering a counter-philtre, so that he may love her no
longer, and she may accept a wealthier suitor. But there is
no limit to the almost diseased imagination of these Cases.
A city<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c008'><sup>[293]</sup></a> is afflicted by famine, and a commissioner is sent to buy
up grain, with orders to return by a certain day. He executes
his commission successfully and quickly, but being driven into
port in a third country by bad weather, sells the grain at a
high price, buys twice as much elsewhere, and returns by the
appointed time. But, meanwhile, the famine has grown so
severe that the people have been driven to cannibalism, which
his return direct with his first bargain would have prevented.
Is he guilty or not guilty?</p>

<p class='c001'>A very little consideration will show that both these classes
of composition must have had great, permanent, and not altogether
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Their influence on style.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
good effects on style. Both dealt with hackneyed
subjects, and in both success was most likely
to be achieved by “peppering higher,” in various ways. The
epideictic subjects suggested various forms of bombast, conceit,
trick, from the use of poetical, archaic, or otherwise unfamiliar
diction to the device of the mouther of whom Seneca tells us,<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c008'><sup>[294]</sup></a>
and who, declaiming on Greeks and Persians, stood a-tiptoe and
cried, “I rejoice! I rejoice!” and only after a due pause explained
the cause of his rejoicing. The forensic subjects tempted the
racking of the brain for some new quibble, some fresh refinement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>or hair-splitting. Especially was this the case in the
subdivision of what were called the <i>colores</i>—ingenious excuses
for the parties, whence comes the special sense of our word
colourable, and whereof Seneca makes a special heading, usually
at the end of his articles. No pitch of mental wiredrawing, no
extravagance of play on word or phrase, was too great for some
declaimers, of whom a certain Murredius is Seneca’s favourite
Helot. In fact, in both classes, epideictic and forensic, one can
see that a plain, forcible, manly style could only be commended
by a combination of very unusual genius on the part of the
speaker, and still more unusual taste and receptivity on the
part of the audience. Their <i>sophos</i>, their <i>euge</i>, their <i>belle</i>,<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c008'><sup>[295]</sup></a> were
much more likely to be evoked by ingenious and far-fetched
conceit than by solid reasoning and Attic style, which latter,
indeed, on such trite subjects were nearly impossible.</p>

<p class='c001'>For illustration of what has been said, the hodge-podge of
Seneca is more valuable than the finished declamations of the
Pseudo-Quintilian. These latter,<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c008'><sup>[296]</sup></a> despite the absurdity, or at
any rate the non-naturalness, of their subject, are sometimes
rather accomplished pieces of writing in a very artificial style.
The speech, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Pro Juvene contra Meretricem</cite></span>, referred to above, is,
in its whimsical way, a decidedly remarkable example of decadent
prose. The crime of making some one cease to love is
odd in itself; the complaint that you have been injured by
being made to cease to love odder still. Besides, if you complain
of this as an injury, do you not still love, and have
you not, therefore, nothing to complain of? The topsyturvyfication
is, it will be seen, complete. And the declaimer, whoever
he was, treats his subject <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>con amore</i></span>. The tricks of his
thought are infinite, and well suited with the artifices of his
speech. In particular, every paragraph leads up to, and winds
up with, a sort of variation on one general theme or <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Leitmotiv</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be compelled to hate is the one incurable form of
disease.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“There is some solace in being miserable in love. 'Tis a
more cruel destiny to hate a harlot.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He who cannot leave off hating a harlot is still her lover.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The victim of a counter-philtre may hate one: he can love
none.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thinker and writer, it will be seen, are a sort of pair of
bounding brothers: they stand on their heads, fling circles,
intertwine limbs, take every non-natural posture, to the utmost
possibility of intellectual acrobatics.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Seneca book,<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c008'><sup>[297]</sup></a> much more fragmentary, is also of its
nature richer. It consists of one book of <a id='corr234.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“Suasories’'>“Suasories”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_234.11'><ins class='correction' title='“Suasories’'>“Suasories”</ins></a></span> (examples
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Seneca the Elder.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of the symbouleutic or epideictic kind), and
ten (by no means completely extant) of “Controversies”
(Forensic subjects), the latter sometimes including introductions
of interest to the writer’s three sons—Novatus,
afterwards Gallio, Seneca the Philosopher, and Mela, father of
the poet Lucan—and usually concluding with a kind of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>résumé</i></span>
(called Excerpta) of their contents. The substance is made up
of short extracts from the most celebrated declaimers of Rome,
and a few Greeks, on the various subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>They give us a really invaluable abundance, in all kinds, of
rhetorical <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>loci communes</i></span>, tags, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pointes</i></span>, with which, from early
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Suasories.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and late practice, the mind of every educated man
at Rome was simply  saturated, and which could
hardly  fail to colour his style, either directly in the way of
imitation, or indirectly in that of repulsion, and preference of
extreme severity.</p>

<p class='c001'>For instance, the first <cite>Suasoria</cite> deals with the question,
“Shall Alexander cross the Ocean?” though the exact statement
of question is lost altogether, with the beginning of the
piece itself. It seems to have opened with a sort of abstract
of general commonplaces, and then come the quotations.
Argentarius [perhaps Marcus the epigrammatist] addresses the
conqueror: “Halt! the world that is thine calls thee back;
we have conquered as far as it was lawful for us. There is
nothing I can seek at the risk of Alexander.” Oscus said: “It
is time for Alexander to leave off where the sun and the earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>leave off likewise,” and endeavoured to describe the sea, “immense
and untried by human experience, the bond of all the
world and the keeper of its lands, the vastness unruffled by any
oar, the shores, now harried by the raging tide, now deserted by
its ebb, the horrid darkness brooding on the waves, and the
eternal night oppressing what nature has withdrawn from
human eyes.” And so many. Then there is a section (headed
<cite>Divisio</cite>), on the particular kind of suasion to be used in such
speeches, the devices which it is safe and proper for orators to
address to kings, with gradations as before. It will readily
be perceived from this example what sort of dealing is here on
the other stock subjects—the deliberation of the three hundred
at Thermopylæ, whether they shall go or not; of Agamemnon,
whether he shall sacrifice Iphigenia; of Alexander, whether he
shall enter Babylon; of the Athenians, whether on Xerxes’
threat of a second invasion they shall remove the Persian war
trophies; of Cicero, whether he shall ask mercy of Antony, or
burn his Philippics. The quotations are sometimes verse as
well as prose, and give us specimens of poets otherwise lost,
with an occasional literary anecdote of interest, such as the
offence which Asinius Pollio<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c008'><sup>[298]</sup></a> took at the praise given to Cicero
in the recitation by a certain poet of Corduba, Sextilius Ena—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Deflendus Cicero est Latiæque silentia linguæ,”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>which Cornelius Severus borrowed, and improved into—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Conticuit Latiæ tristis facundia linguæ.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>This anecdote is interesting in many ways,—first for the protest
of Pollio, almost equally piquant whether it proceeded
from critical severity, from personal jealousy, or from political
feeling; and secondly, for the evidence it gives of the straining
for point and rhetorical “hit,” in verse and prose alike.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Preface of the First Book of the <cite>Controversies</cite>—addressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>to the three sons—gives a rather interesting view of the scheme
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Controversies: <i>their Introductions</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of these curious compositions, which seems to have
been that Seneca the father should brush up his
memory of the golden or nearly golden age of Latin
Rhetoric which immediately followed Cicero, and
illustrate it from more strictly literary sources. A good deal
in the piece (as is usual in the better class of rhetorical writing)
bears directly on our subject. The old rhetorician commends
his sons for extending their view beyond their own age, for
wanting to know what Roman eloquence there was to set
against “insolent Greece”<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c008'><sup>[299]</sup></a>—in short, for endeavouring to
take that comparative view of at least one division of literature
the want of which (as we have so fully set forth) was the crying
sin and yet the inevitable weakness of Greek criticism. He has
the usual complaint of luxury withdrawing men from literature,
which was doubtless as true, and as little peculiar, then as at
all other times. He lets us know that there were none (or no
good) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>commentarii</i></span> of the best declaimers, that he himself had
heard them all except Cicero, whom, as far as chronology went,
he might have heard,<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c008'><sup>[300]</sup></a> but for the confusions of the state: he
points out that the regular declamation was a rather late
growth, and extols the character of Porcius Latro, one of its
oldest practitioners. The Introduction to the Second Book is
much shorter, and principally celebrates the ability of Arellius
Fuscus. The Third (for the text of which we only have the
Excerpts, not the full articles) has an important preface, which
starts from the fact or assertion that Cassius Severus, a great
orator on serious occasions, was not a good declaimer, though he
had good bodily advantages, a voice at once powerful and sweet,
a delivery with all the merits and none of the drawbacks of
the stage, and an extraordinary faculty of improvisation. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>seems that Seneca once asked him why these faculties failed
him in set <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>agonismata</i></span>, and his answer (whether to the point or
not) is of the very first interest, as illustrating that difficult
point of the ancient conjunction of oratory and literature, and
also as a counterblast to the Plinian idea (<i>v. infra</i>) of the poly-historic
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>littérateur</i></span>. “What great wit,” said he, “has ever been
good at more than one thing [whereby, let it be observed, he
separates declamation from oratory]? Did not Cicero’s eloquence
fail him in verse? Virgil’s genius in prose? We read
the orations of Sallust simply as a compliment to the historian:
and the oration of that most eloquent man Plato, which is
written for Socrates, is worthy neither of counsel nor of client.”</p>

<p class='c001'>All these things invite comment—the last most of all. I put
aside, as entirely irrelevant, certain modern dubitations as to
the genuineness of the Platonic <cite>Apology</cite>. They rest upon no
warranty of scripture, and opinion is simply opinion, to be received
politely, and to be “laid on the table.” But it is worth
dwelling on the point that the <cite>Apology</cite> as we have it, though
to all competent judges of literature one of the capital works
of antiquity, arch-worthy of Plato, more than arch-worthy of
Socrates, might very well seem to a Roman lawyer unworthy
of both, and might possibly have so seemed to Aristotle <a id='corr237.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='himself'>himself.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_237.22'><ins class='correction' title='himself'>himself.</ins></a></span>
For of all recorded <i>plaidoyers</i> it is perhaps, in the temper of the
jury and the circumstances of the case, the least likely to secure
an acquittal, and the most likely to render condemnation inevitable.
The other remarks do not matter so much; but it is
of weight that a man should seriously put the difference between
Declamation and practical Oratory on the same footing
as the difference between poetry and prose. It shows how
ill-adjusted, as yet, the grasp of literary criticism was, and also
how necessary it is to keep an eye on everything that is said
about Rhetoric, if we are really to master what was thought
about Criticism. The introduction to the Fourth Book, again
one of Excerpts only, gives the information that Asinius Pollio
(whose works, if we had them, would probably be of the greatest
possible value to <em>us</em>) disliked declaiming in public, but was,
on the rare occasions when he could be heard thus exercising
himself, more florid than in his actual orations. We can well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>believe it, and it shows that Pollio had the root of the matter
in him. In the same way a man with critical sense will allow
himself, in a rough draft, flowers which he cuts out in the most
ruthless manner before he prints.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Fifth and Sixth books, which are in the same fragmentary
condition, have no introductions at all; but the seventh is in
better case. Like the others, it is mainly devoted to the characteristics
of a single orator—in this case Silius Albucius.
Some of the things said about him touch us nearly, as, for
instance, Pollio’s—the severe Pollio’s—description of his <em>sentences</em>
(axioms, maxims, apophthegms) as “white”—that is to
say, simple, clear, with nothing obscure or unexpected,—but
“vocal” and “splendid.” It was impossible, continues Seneca,
to complain of the poverty of the Latin tongue when you
heard him: he was never in the very least in pain for a word.
Yet, on the other hand, he was not equal. His language was
at one moment magnificent, at another he would mention the
most sordid things—"vinegar, and pennyroyal, and lanterns,
and pumice, and sponges." He thought “nothing must <em>not</em> be
named in a declamation [and the reason is valuable or invaluable]
because he feared to smack of the Schools.” And yet
further we get the important <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>obiter dictum</i></span>: “Familiar phrase is,
among oratorical virtues, a thing which rarely succeeds.” And
then there is a very luminous and jocund anecdote of the real
trouble into which the devotion to Figures might even then
bring men. Albucius had rhetorically proposed to administer
certain oaths. His opponent, L. Arruntius, very coolly rose and
said, “We accept the condition: he shall swear.” Albucius protested
that this would do away with Figures altogether. Quoth
Arruntius (very sensibly), “Let them go—we can do without
them”: and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>centumviri</i></span> allowed the catch. The unlucky
orator was so annoyed that he renounced actual pleading from
that day, because of the insult done to his beloved Figures.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Eighth Book is again without its preface; but though
there is a very large lacuna in ix., we have part of the introduction.
It yields little. The last is in better case, but still not
very fertile, though we have another instance of the mania for
Figures. It is said of the above-quoted Oscus: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Dum nihil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>non schemate dicere cupit, oratio ejus non figurata erat sed
prava.”</span> Certainly there are no few examples of this “pravity”
in the declamations themselves, which it would be interesting,
but in our space impossible, to examine, as we have examined
the prefaces.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c008'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>They, however, also contain examples of that severity of
taste which has always distinguished Latin criticism, and of
which Pollio is the great example. Messala, as we learn, was
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Latini utique sermonis observator diligentissimus</i></span>, and he said of
Latro (whom Seneca’s later taste admired) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<i>sua</i> lingua disertus
est”</span>—"He is an eloquent man in his own lingo." Seneca himself,
however, is by no means tolerant of excessive conceit, and
rebukes the class of “sentence” which, he tells us, some charged
upon Publilius as inventor. The examples given are in the
case of a disinherited son found with poison, which he spills
on discovery in the interior of his father’s house: and the
sentences are, “He washed out his disinheriting with poison,
and what he spilt was my death,” both being supposed to be
spoken by the father. And in another stock case—the curious
one which has more than one historical analogue, where the
Prætor Flamininus was accused of having had a condemned
man’s throat cut at dinner, to amuse a courtesan who said she
had never seen a man die—the unlucky Murredius is said
to have arranged a <i>tetracolon</i>—a four-membered antithesis:
“The courts are made subservient to the bed-chamber; the
prætor to a harlot; the prison to the banquet; day to night”;
as to which last Seneca justly asks, “What sense has it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, this very valuable and interesting book, which
has been spoken of with surprisingly uncritical contempt by
some, and to which I should like to devote much greater
space, forms, with Pliny’s <cite>Letters</cite> and Quintilian, the great
trinity of documents for appreciating directly the state of
Latin opinion as to literature, and its causes, in the first century
after Christ, while with Cicero and Horace it forms a
similar trinity for that in the last century before Christ. And
it is needless to say that these two periods were, early <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>avant-coureurs</i></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and belated decadents excepted, the flourishing time
of classical Latin literature. Of this state and these causes we
shall speak generally later.</p>

<p class='c001'>One writer of famous memory who belongs to this period—who
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Varro.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
indeed was older even than Cicero—has been hitherto
unmentioned, because, as a matter of fact, we have
practically no literary criticism remaining from
him, and that is Varro. I should myself have been disposed
to relegate the author of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Re Rustica</cite></span> and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Lingua
Latina</cite></span> to the place of his brother (or grandson) grammarians;
but this might seem unceremonious in face of the importance
of the critical position which Professor Nettleship assigned to
him. It is, perhaps, also a convenient place to notice the exact
character of that importance. As in so many other cases, if
we went by titles only, and by guesswork from them, Varro
must certainly have a high rank. “On Poets,” “On Poems,”
“On Characters” (in the technical Greek sense of literary
<i>differentia</i>?), “On Scenic Action,” “Plautine Questions,” might
seem at first sight likely to be, if we had them, a very El
Dorado of Latin criticism. But the few surviving fragments
are a little discouraging. That Varro would be fertile in
grammatical, mythological, social explanation, we may be
quite certain. But the fragments seldom go much farther.
The report, quoted by Quintilian, of Ælius Stilo’s saying
that if the Muses wrote Latin they would write in the
language of Plautus, is one of those rather irritating critical
catchwords which carry with them the minimum of critical
illumination. It is, in fact, only an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad captandum</i></span> fashion of
saying that the speaker liked Plautus, or wanted to pay him
a compliment at the moment. Most of the others seem (as
indeed Mr Nettleship saw) to be merely examples, either of
the habits of “placing” authors in this or that rank, of comparing
them with this or that other, from which criticism
has suffered many things and gained few, or else of the
not much less barren classification of kinds.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is on the first point that I wish to make a slight digression.
It is evident from the epithets that he uses in regard to them,
such as “stupid,” “trifling,” “vicious,” that these processes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>placing and of comparison were not to Mr Nettleship’s taste.
I shall myself admit that the addiction of Greek, and still
more of Latin, criticism to them seems to me to be among
the very greatest weaknesses of both. But I must add a
distinction which is constantly forgotten, and which I am
not sure that Mr Nettleship himself had in mind. The
“placing” of A, B, C, and D in order of merit is “stupid”
and “trifling” enough; the still further awarding of seventh
place to A for Somethingity, and of third to B for Somethingelseness,
is more stupid and more trivial still. Nor is that
comparative criticism, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>locus classicus</i></span> of which is perhaps
M. Taine’s ejaculation, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“J’aime mieux Alfred de Musset,”</span> as
a criticism on Tennyson, any better; in fact, as being not
merely sterile and jejune, but illogical and actively misleading,
it is considerably worse. But there <em>is</em> a placing and
there <em>is</em> a comparison, which are two very different things—which
are, in fact, the two highways of all real literary
criticism. The placing is that which sets a man, not in the
first division of the first class, or the second of the third,
but in his relations to time and country, to language and
manner, to predecessors and successors—to the whole literary
map in larger or smaller circumference. The comparison is
that which does not work out a performer’s rank, but disengages
his qualities. These are the methods to which all
the great critics have perforce resorted, and which have made
them great. That there is less of them than there should
be in ancient criticism may be true enough; that the want
of them (with perhaps a little want also of sympathy with
the highest poetry) is what prevents Aristotle from being
the greatest critic of all time, is true enough; that the
presence of them in Longinus is one of the main secrets of
his unmatched quality, is true enough. But they are very
different things from the enumeration of Volcatius Sedigitus,
and from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in argumentis Cæcilius in ethesin Terentius
in sermonibus Plautus</i></span> of Varro.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c008'><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c017' />
<div class='footnote' id='f275'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r275'>275</a>. Probably the very temperament,
which spurs the critic on to his business,
afflicts him with this thorn in the
flesh. I should not be surprised if examples
of it were found in the present
volume. But it has been kept down as
far as possible.</p>

is an Essay of the first excellence
on the subject by the late Mr Henry
Nettleship (reprinted at vol. ii. p. 44
of his <cite>Lectures and Essays</cite>, Oxford,
1895). In my case old personal obligations
were not needed to deepen the
admiration which every one, who would
even like to be a scholar, must feel for
Mr Nettleship’s work. I am here, however,
to demur to his opening division
of criticism into “criticism of philosophy,
which investigates the principles
of beauty,” and “isolated and spontaneous
judgments, never rising beyond
personal impression.” It is one main
purpose of this book to show that a
third course is possible and desirable,
by way of the wide and systematic
comparison of the manifestations of
literary beauty in the accomplished
work of letters.</p>

my judgment of Cicero’s verse is rather
harsh, and that he at any rate made
some progress towards the Lucretian
hexameter before Lucretius. It may
be so; tolerably careful and tolerably
wide students of literature know that
these things are always “in the air,”
and that, sometimes if not always, you
find them in the poetaster before you
find them in the poet. But after
reading all Cicero’s extant verse two
or three times over, seeking diligently
for mitigations of judgment, I am still
afraid that “Cousin Cicero, you will
never be a poet,” would have been, and
justly, the verdict of Lucretius, had
they stood to one another in the relations
in which Swift and Dryden
stood.</p>

139-266. Our greatest English Latinists
recently have been singularly
unkind to this poet. Munro made
what I can only call a violent attack on
him: and Mr Nettleship, while allowing
him “extraordinary vigour” and
“the ring of Caius Gracchus” (see his

practically indorses this. Against
such judges I should not have a word
to say on the linguistic side: but I
claim  full <i>parrhesia</i> on the literary.
The Virtue passage (which Munro
specially refuses to except) is as rough
as, say, Marston; but it has a far
sincerer, loftier, and more truly poetical
tone than anything of the kind
in Horace, and than most things in
Juvenal. And everywhere I see quality,
passion, <em>phrase</em>. Here, at least, I can
agree with Cicero (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Orat.</cite></span>, ii. 6 and

<p class='c007'>From the later years of Augustus, and the earlier of his
immediate successors, we have no criticism of importance
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Petronius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
except Seneca’s. But the Neronian time has left us
interesting approaches to the subject in the works of
Petronius and Seneca the younger, as well as in the poet
Persius; while, somewhat later, the satires of Juvenal and the
epigrams of Martial are, the former not destitute, the latter
full, of literary allusion and opinion. These, with a certain
contribution from Pliny’s <cite>Letters</cite> and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dialogus de Claris
Oratoribus</cite></span> (usually included among the works of Tacitus, but
not resembling him in style, and sometimes attributed to
Quintilian), must be successively dealt with. Quintilian himself
is of too great importance not to deserve a separate
chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>We can understand, as well from the character usually given
of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Arbiter elegantiarum</cite></span> as from the style of his curiously
dismembered and rather disreputable written work,<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c008'><sup>[303]</sup></a> that questions
of literary criticism must have been of the first interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>to him. If we had the entire <cite>Satires</cite> (supposing that they
ever were more entire than <cite>Tristram Shandy</cite> or the <cite>Moyen
de Parvenir</cite>), there can be very little doubt that this element
would show itself in very large proportion. There must have
been suppers less brutally vulgar and Philistine than that
of Trimalchio; and literary discussion was as indispensable
at a Roman supper of the better class as broiled bones at
an English one—while suppers lasted. Even the Circes,
if not the Quartillas, of the time were very frequently “blue”
in the intervals of more exciting amusements, and Agamemnon,
Eumolpus,<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c008'><sup>[304]</sup></a> and others must have frequently spoken in character.
As it is, the opening of the fragment as we have it,
and a passage farther on, deal directly with the subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>The opening passage is occupied with that denunciation of
bombastic and “precious” language which seems to have been
the favourite occupation of the critics of the time. The attack
is at first directed against the practice of declamation, which
almost inevitably tempted boys and youthful writers to bombast,
but it so quickly glides into a general literary censure that
it is worth giving in full.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I believe that the reason why schoolboys and students
become such fools is, that they never see or hear of anything to
which we are accustomed in the actual world. They are occupied
by pirates standing on the beach with chains in their
hands, by tyrants ordaining that sons shall cut their fathers’
heads off, by oracles against a pestilence to the effect that three
or more virgins are to be sacrificed, by little bundles of words
smeared with honey, and everything, as it were, powdered with
poppy-seed and sesamum. For people bred in this fashion
sense is as impossible as a pleasant odour for those who live in
the kitchen.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c008'><sup>[305]</sup></a> If you will excuse my saying so, you rhetoricians
were the first to ruin literature. By exciting ridicule
of [<em>or</em> playing tricks with] your light and empty phrases,<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c008'><sup>[306]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>you weakened and prostrated the whole body of oratory. Youth
had not yet been enslaved to declamations when Sophocles and
Euripides devised the words in which they were to speak. The
private schoolmaster<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c008'><sup>[307]</sup></a> had not spoilt good wits when Pindar
and the Nine Lyrists feared to sing in Homeric verse. And not
to allege poets only, I certainly find it nowhere said that Plato
and Demosthenes betook themselves to this kind of eloquence.
Oratory full grown, and, if I may say so, in her maidenhood, is
not spotted and swelling [like a toad], but shoots up in natural
beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of late this windy and extravagant loquacity has shifted
from Asia to Athens, and has breathed upon the aspiring minds
of youth like a pestilential star, and forthwith true eloquence,
its rule corrupted, has been arrested, and put to silence. Tell
me, who has since equalled the fame of Thucydides, of Hyperides?
Not so much as a lyric of wholesome complexion has
appeared, and everything, as if poisoned with the same food,
has been unable to last to a natural grey old age. Even painting
has made no better end, since the audacity of the Egyptians
has cut so great an art down to shorthand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The rhetorician Agamemnon defends scholastic procedure by
the old plan of throwing the blame on parents and the like; but
the story quickly turns to one of its more than “picaresque”
episodes, and the subject drops.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other passage<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c008'><sup>[308]</sup></a> begins with equal abruptness, and serves as
preface only to a very much longer poetical recitation by Eumolpus,
who speaks it. It is chiefly noteworthy for containing
the phrase <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Curiosa felicitas</i></span>, applied to Horace, which perhaps
itself gives us as good a notion of Petronius’ critical faculty as
anything could. But it conveys some sound doctrine. Verse
itself seems easy; any boy thinks he can write it as soon as he
has learnt the rules, and retired orators (a hit, I suppose, at
Cicero) compose it as a relaxation, as if it were easier than their
speeches. But it is no such light matter. You must take choice
words [we are almost at Dante’s “sifted” words], words far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>from the use of the vulgar crowd,<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c008'><sup>[309]</sup></a> and at the same time you
must be careful that individual phrases are not too fine for the
rest. Nor must you treat your subject—civil war, for instance—in
the mere tone of a chronicler, but the “free spirit must
be forced through<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c008'><sup>[310]</sup></a> difficulties, and the ministry of the gods,
and a fabulous torment of sentences, so that it may rather
appear the vaticination of a frenzied mind than a trustworthy
and scrupulous document under attestation.” Now this advice,
though much in it is sound, takes distinctly the other side
to that which Encolpius had urged in the overture.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the whole, we must regret very keenly that we have not
more of the Arbiter’s remarks on the subject. It is improbable
that anything like a coherent theory of criticism on the great
scale would have emerged, and very likely that (as in the two
extant examples just quoted) we should rather have had ingenious
centos of opposing views. But all would have been
originally and brightly put, and it is by no means impossible
that what we now chiefly desiderate—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>aperçus</i></span> of particular
authors, books, or passages, done with grasp and insight—would
have been forthcoming. As it is, we have but what we have.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nero’s other victim, the curious compound between Polonius
and Mr Pecksniff (with, it must be owned, some merits which
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Seneca the Younger.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
belonged to neither), whose name was L. Annæus
Seneca, has left us a great deal more work than
Petronius, and was certainly a man of letters. He was even a
considerable man of letters, and if he wrote the <cite>Tragedies</cite>, a very
considerable man of letters indeed.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c008'><sup>[311]</sup></a> He had, moreover, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>scarcely a good, a distinct and by no means commonplace style,
and while Quintilian attacks him <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nominatim</i></span> in a passage
which will occupy us later, it is by no means improbable that
Petronius (who must have known him well, and was probably
bored by him) had Seneca himself in his mind when he talked
of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ventosa et enormis loquacitas</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Seneca, however, was by profession a Stoic, and these
classical Pharisees, though their sect was not exactly unliterary,
pushed to an extreme the partly superfine, partly puritanic,
contempt with which, as we have seen, the philosophy of
antiquity generally chose to regard the minutiæ of literary
criticism and literary craft. The “wise man of the Stoics”
might be a perfect man of letters, as he was a perfect everything
else; but it was entirely beneath him to take seriously
such things as metre, or style, or the pleasure of literary art.
In the Tenth Dialogue, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Brevitate Vitæ</cite></span>,<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c008'><sup>[312]</sup></a> after the philosopher
has been talking in his high-sniffing way of collecting brasses,
singing, giving long and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>recherché</i></span> dinners (but not, so far as I
remember, of putting out money at usury), he begins a new
chapter with things to be treated more contemptuously still.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Twould be long,” he says, “to track them all out—those
whose life draughts, or ball-playing, or the practice of carefully
cooking their flesh in the sun, has caused to waste away.
They are not exactly lazy people, since their pleasures give
them a great deal of trouble. For nobody can doubt that they
make much ado about nothing, who are detained by the study
of useless letters—there is a considerable company of them
among us Romans. It has been a mania of the Greeks to
inquire how many rowers Ulysses had, whether the <cite>Iliad</cite> was
written earlier than the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, further, whether the two are
by the same author, and other matters of the same stamp,
which, if you keep to yourself, they will not help your silent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>conscience, while, if you talk about them, you will seem not
more learned but only more of a bore.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The rest of the chapter draws up a long list of similar
enormities of curiosity—historical and literary. “Who had the
first naval triumph?” &amp;c. Seneca even ironically supplies questions
of the kind, and information about them, to those who like
such things. Elsewhere in the 88th (the third of the thirteenth
book)<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c008'><sup>[313]</sup></a> of those not disagreeable epistles which he composed
for the edification of a man of straw called Lucilius, and for the
display of his own ability, he supposes the definite question to
be put to him, “What do you think of liberal studies?” and
he goes off at score in the true style of the Stoic pulpit. He
respects none, counts none as good. They are all very well as
exercises, as preparations; you may stick to them as long as
you can do nothing better. They are called “liberal,” as
worthy of a free man: but there is only one study worthy of
a freeman (does one not hear the very drone of the ancestor of
Mr Chadband?), and that is the study of WISDOM. All else
is petty and puerile: it has nothing to do with making a GOOD
man. Will the grammarian, who, if he does not stick to mere
philology, goes to history or, at farthest, to poetry, be a road-maker
for us to VIRTUE, my brethren? Will syntax and
prosody banish fear, quench cupidity, bridle lust? And so forth.
He makes, indeed, not bad fun of the attempts to make out
Homer now a Stoic, now an Epicurean, now a Peripatetic. But
he soon relapses into the “chaff and draff” of the conventional
moralists at all times. What are the tempests that impelled
Ulysses to the storms of the mind? What does it matter
whether Penelope was chaste? Teach me what Chastity <em>is</em>.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Et patati et patata.</i></span> From a man in this frame of mind comes
no good critical thing; though we certainly should like to have
heard from the Tragedian, whoever he was, what put into his
head the idea of that remarkable compromise between Classic
and Romantic Tragedy which gave us the Latin <cite>Hippolytus</cite> and
the <cite>Octavia</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The three satiric poets give us both directly and indirectly a
great deal of matter; in fact, they may almost be said to provide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>the illustrative commentary to their contemporary and
friend<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c008'><sup>[314]</sup></a> Quintilian’s precepts. It is possible that
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The satirists.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the example of Horace may have had something to
do with this; but such an example need not have been required.
As we know, not merely from themselves, the first century at
Rome, if not one of the very greatest times of literary production,
was one of very great and very widespread literary
interest. As Persius tells us—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Ecce inter pocula quærunt</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Romulidæ saturi, quid dia poemata narrent;”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>while Seneca’s remarks, take them with what grains of salt we
will, are sound corroborative evidence. Further, it appears on
all hands, not merely that there was a distinct fashion of literature,
but that this fashion had its own distinct characteristics,
that it was one of the times of ornate as opposed to plain
style in verse and prose alike, a time of “preciousness,” of “raising
the language to a higher power,” a time when men openly
called Cicero a commonplace and obvious writer, and, if they
did not fail to pay a kind of conventional reverence to Virgil,
wrote in a way as far as possible from being Virgilian. This
always gives plenty of handles to the poetical satirist, and, as
we shall see, all the three availed themselves of these handles
to the full.</p>

<p class='c001'>The scanty and notable work of Persius—work which, in the
junction of these two qualities, has hardly a parallel in literary
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Persius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
history, except that of Collins in English—is soaked
in criticism of literature as well as of life. The
poet’s turbid rush of thought and style, forcing its way through
self-created obstacles but still forcing it, thick with suspended
matter, but all the richer therefor, allows him not merely to
deal directly with this subject, but in dealing with others to
make constant allusion and by-blow. The famous
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Prologue and First Satire.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
scazontic prologue, with its affected language, satirising
affectation, and its conceits, giving an object-lesson
of conceited style, is all literary except the moral, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quoad</i></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“Master Gaster, first Master of Arts,” as Rabelais refashioned
it fifteen hundred years later. The “horsy fountain” and the
sleep on “two-headed” Parnassus, the relinquishment of the
Muses to those whom such ladies concern, and the final fling
about the crow-poets and poetess-magpies, may be gibes at
dabblers in literature: but they show that the giber is steeped
in literature himself, and has taken a critical as well as a
delighted bath therein. And the first satire (the longest but
one) is wholly and directly devoted to the subject. With the
old device of a cool objecting friend, Persius takes occasion,
while declaring (also an old trick) his own honest desire to
keep to better matters, to draw a lively picture of the professional
poet, or declamation-writer, scribbling in his locked
study, arraying himself in his best clothes, and even with such
jewelry as he can muster, carefully gargling his throat, and
then tickling the ears of his audience, and comforting himself,
when anybody objects the worthlessness of such applause, by
the plea—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>A still livelier picture follows of the symposium referred to in
the lines above quoted as to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Romulidæ saturi</cite></span>; of the literary
dandy in hyacinthine garment mincing and twanging through
his nose some morbid stuff (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rancidulum quiddam</i></span>) about Phyllis
and Hypsipyle, and being cheered in a fashion fit to make the
poet’s ashes happy, his slab lie lighter on his tomb, and violets
spring therefrom.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he draws in his horns a little. Verse, of course, is not
necessarily bad because it is popular only. But <i>Euge!</i> and
<i>Belle!</i> are not the be-all and end-all of literature. What
wretched stuff has not received them? How often have they
not been consideration for a good dinner, and a cloak just a
little torn! And what is even genuine popular judgment
worth? Why do not poets adopt honest Roman subjects,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>instead of chattering about unreal Hellenics? And why do
they affect such antiquated and unnatural style? What is
the good of borrowing such stuff as</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>of ranging everything <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in doctis figuris</i></span>, and of writing passages,
such as two famous ones which he quotes, and which are
traditionally asserted to be the work of Nero himself. He
exhausts his images of scorn on these unlucky lines, and
holds up <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Arma virum</i></span> against them as an example of natural
knotty strength against effeminate drivel. And to a fresh
protest of his friends about the danger of this kind of criticism,
he replies by an ironical consent to declare it all very
good, and a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>coda</i></span> of regret for the time when Lucilius used
what freedom of speech he chose, when Horace laughed at
everybody without giving offence, more seriously declaring
that, whether he can publish or not, he will <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>write</i></span> as the giants
of the Old Comedy wrote.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this lively crabbed production there are two distinct
strains or bents to note. All the best critics have for some
time admitted that in professed satire generally, and in Roman
satire more than in any other, there is, if not a touch of cant,
at any rate a distinct convention of moral indignation—a sort of
stock-part of bluff, honestly old-fashioned, censuring of modern
corruption—which the satirist takes up as a matter of business.
Even Martial, upon whom, Heaven knows! it sits oddly enough,
though his consummate dexterity carries it off not ill, affects
this now and then; it sometimes suggests itself even through
the gloomy intensity of Juvenal; and though such a line as
Persius’ famous</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>carries us far out of the dissenting-pulpiteer region where
Seneca too often gesticulates, there is in this First Satire, at
any rate, some suspicion of forced wrath, of the righteous
overmuch.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the other strand in the twist, the other glance of the
view, is in a very different state. There is nothing unreal, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>all appearance, in the poet’s condemnation of the preciousness
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Examination of this.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and conceit of poetic and prose style in his day.
That his own is very far from simple or Attic does
not matter; the satire had a prescriptive right to be crabbed,
archaic, irregular, bizarre. Whether political dislike of the
tyrant did not sharpen literary objection to the poetaster (if
the lines really are Nero’s) may be a debatable question for
those who care to debate it; but, in any case, the objection
was there, and seems to have been quite genuine. Now, as
has been often pointed out, these definite passages, definitely
objected to or praised, are precisely what we want most, and
have least of, in ancient criticism. A short examination of
them, therefore, will serve our turn very well.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first passage appears to be cited chiefly as an objectionable
example of archaism. We shall see that Quintilian
(perhaps in obedience to this very passage, for he knew his
Persius, and admired him) repeats the objection to the word
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ærumna</i></span><a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c008'><sup>[316]</sup></a>—to us a word not in the least objectionable, but the
contrary. And if it be said that foreigners, and especially
foreigners who acknowledge themselves entirely uncertain
about the probable pronunciation of Latin, have no business
to give an opinion about the euphony of words, the retort is
obvious and pretty triumphant. To <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>some</i></span> Romans, at any
rate, if not to Persius and Quintilian, the word must have
sounded agreeable, or as poets they would not have used,
and as hearers or readers would not have applauded, it. The
conceit of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“cor <i>fulta</i> ærumnis”</span>—with heart stretched on
pillows of woes—was no doubt another crime, and it is not
improbable that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>luctificabile</i></span> was a third. The Romans had
a rather pedantic horror of long words, which is again formulated
by Quintilian, just as it is implied and exemplified
here.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the same type and colour is the objection to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rasa antitheta</i></span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>doctæ figuræ</i></span> which follows, as well as that to the vowel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>harmony, the soft cadence, the mouth-watering<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c008'><sup>[317]</sup></a> tenderness of
the Neronian fragments. We may, without rashness, point
to the soft sound of “Berecynthius Attin,” the alliteration of
“<i>di</i>rimebat” and “<i>Del</i>phin” with the internal half-rhyme of
“<i>cær</i>uleum” and “<i>Ner</i>ea,” the leonine effect of “long<i>o</i>” and
“Apennin<i>o</i>” and the two tetrasyllables, with the sudden pull
up of the spondaic ending, as what irritated Persius. This
same accompaniment of sound, and cunning contrast or echo of
vowels, recurs in the second and more coherent extract: “<i>Tor</i>va,
<i>cor</i>nua”; “Mimal<i>lon</i>eis <i>bom</i>bis,” “<i>rap</i>tum <i>cap</i>ut”; “vitul<i>o</i> superb<i>o</i>”;
“<i>lyn</i>cem co<i>rym</i>bis”; the long words “reparabilis”
and “Mimalloneis,” with the foreign effect of the latter and
others. These, no doubt, were the things which annoyed our
poet here.</p>

<p class='c001'>A little reflection will make this annoyance exceedingly
interesting. Not merely is the general effect of these lines
very similar to that of hundreds and thousands of lines, in the
earlier English Romantic school from Marlowe to Chamberlayne,
in the later from Keats to Mr Swinburne; but the indignation
of Persius is exactly similar, if not to the almost incredulous
and disgusted disdain with which the critics and poets of
the “school of good sense” looked back on the vagaries of their
predecessors, to the alarmed and furious attempt made by
critics of the present century to extinguish contemporaries who
indulged in such things. Persius on Nero, if Nero it was, no
doubt gave hints to, and, with hardly less doubt, was himself
quite in sympathy with, the <cite>Quarterly</cite> Reviewers of Keats and
Tennyson. There is the same protest against the effeminate,
the luscious, the unrestrained, the same indignant demand for
manliness, order, sanity.</p>

<p class='c001'>But we may go even further. These same processes, which
we have ventured to point out as certainly illustrated by the
gibbeted verses, and as probably accounting for the wrath of
their executioner, are the very processes by which all our great
nineteenth-century poets in English have produced their characteristic
effects—alliteration, internal rhyme or assonance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>complete or muffled, and, above all, the modulation of vowel
and consonant so as to produce a sort of song without music,
accompanying the actual words. And it may be noted that
while some of our modern critics have objected to these things
in themselves, many more, oddly enough, object to the process
of pointing them out, and seem to think that there is something
almost indecent in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be unreasonable to expect that in the narrow compass
of some six hundred lines this passage—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>locus uberrimus
fructuosissimusque</i></span>, to borrow the Ciceronian superlatives—should
repeat itself. But the literary interest of Persius, as
regards criticism, is by no means exhausted. The next three
satires are indeed wholly occupied by the exposition of that
practical, honest, upright, rather hard, rather limited morality
which it is the pride of Rome to have carried as far as mere
morality of the sort can travel. But the beginnings of the
fifth<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c008'><sup>[318]</sup></a> and sixth<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c008'><sup>[319]</sup></a> have a literary and critical turn in them,
and though the course of the satire is afterwards deflected, these
beginnings show the same man, the same tastes, the same
standards that we have seen in the first. Don’t potter over
fantastic subjects and sham Greek epics, but attack something
Roman and serious. Whatever you write, write it in a manly
fashion, with no æsthetic trifling. That is the critical gospel
of Persius, and he sets it forth with a vigour which we shall
seldom find equalled, and with (in the instance we have dwelt
upon) a most fortunate fertility of illustration.</p>

<p class='c001'>The far bulkier work of Juvenal—work also of far higher
genius in parts, but more unequal and uncertain—contains less
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Juvenal.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that concerns our subject. It is impossible to mistake
in Persius, young as he died, and scanty as are
his remains, a very direct interest in literary form, such as did
not always or often accompany Stoic philosophy. Juvenal,
with a less definite philosophical creed, and perhaps a rather
lower moral standard, had a higher “Pisgah-sight” and a
stronger grasp of life as a whole. However long Persius had
lived, it is improbable that he would ever have given us anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>equal to the magnificent Tenth Satire. But Juvenal,
much more of a pessimist than Persius, was less capable of
enthusiasm. His general critical standpoint does not seem to
have been very different from that of his predecessor, or indeed
(allowing for the vastly greater difference of temperament) from
that which we shall find in Martial. But to Juvenal literature
as literature had no special pre-eminence among the contents
of his famous <i>farrago</i>. It would even appear that, although
practising it greatly himself, he had a rather special contempt
for it.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c008'><sup>[320]</sup></a> The well-known opening of the First Satire<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c008'><sup>[321]</sup></a> agrees
with Persius and with Martial in its scorn of artificial Greek
epics, of sham heroic subjects and forms generally. But there
pierces through it something of a special contempt for “Grub
Street”—for the unlucky “Codrus”—who reappears, not always
to be abused, but always to be dismissed with a sort of kick of
contempt. There is something more than the stock superciliousness
of the satirist in the thousand times quoted</p>

<p class='c021'>The same tone is maintained throughout, and when poetry
and literature appear (which is not extremely often), poets and
men of letters are treated as practitioners of a rather troublesome,
nearly superfluous, and slightly disreputable, profession, not
as bad or good artists as the case may be. The stage-fright of
the rhetorician who is going to make a speech at Lyons (the
gird at the provincial is obvious), the book-chest of Codrus,
with the mice gnawing the divine poems, the Greek mania
which alternates with others in wives, and the learned lady who
talks for hours on the comparative merits of Homer and Virgil,
are introduced with the poet’s usual spirit and vigour, but very
distinctly <em>not</em> from the literary point of view. They are ludicrous
things and persons, good satiric matter: but the book-chest
is in the same class with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lectus Procula minor</i></span>, the fancy for
Greek with the fancy for gladiators, the critical lady with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>sister who enamels her face. It is by no means un-noteworthy
that, in the Tenth itself, the vanity of literary study and success—an
admirably suggestive subject—is hardly touched at all; that
the careers of Demosthenes and Cicero are held up as a moral
because of their political ill-success, and the sanguinary fate of
each—which might have happened to the most illiterate of men.
But this is most noticeable of all in the Seventh, which may be
said to have a definitely literary frame and scheme, or which at
least certainly would have had these in the hands of a man
really inclined to literary criticism. It opens with a characteristic
picture of what the Americans would call a “slump”
in poetry—the most celebrated bards giving up the profession
in sheer despair, becoming bath-keepers, or stokers, or
auctioneers’ criers, selling their tragedies at rummage sales,
or at the very best getting empty praise and no pudding from
their stingy though wealthy patrons. Then Juvenal becomes
a little graver, and contrasts the victim of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cacoethes scribendi</i></span>
with the really exceptional poet (whom he cannot point out,
and only imagines), who will put forth no hack-work, and
writes not even for fame, but to please himself and the Muses.
Such a poet must be in independent circumstances—if Virgil
had had no boy to wait on him, and no tolerable lodging, all
the snakes would have dropped from the hair of his Erinyes,
says he in one of his most characteristic Juvenalisms. Lucan
happened to be well off: but Statius, for all the popularity of
his <cite>Thebais</cite>, would have gone dinnerless if he had not sold his
<cite>Agave</cite> to the actor Paris (apparently to pass off as his own).<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c008'><sup>[322]</sup></a>
Nor is the historian’s labour more profitable. Indeed it is less
so, for it consumes more paper, more time, and more oil for the
lamp, as Juvenal points out in what some modern reviewers
would call “his flippant manner.” Even the much-praised
trade of the orator brings in wretched fees as a rule—a ham, a
jar of sardines, a bunch of onions, half-a-dozen of common wine.
If you wish to soar higher in the matter of receipts, you must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>spend greatly, have handsome horses, furniture, rings. Merely
teaching to declaim may be rather more profitable, but think of
the intolerable boredom of the business! the same patter of
stock declamations and exercises, the unreality and folly of it all!
True, there are exceptions—and here comes a curious passage,
half satirical, half complimentary, on Quintilian himself, but
treating him not in the least from the literary standpoint. And
so to the end.</p>

<p class='c001'>This abstract, though brief, should be sufficient to establish
our point—that Juvenal, while he rarely cared to touch strictly
literary subjects, hardly ever treated them in a strictly literary
manner. He shared the opinion of the best Roman literary
judges at all times—and especially in his own times, when the
popular current was setting in the opposite direction—that
literary style ought to be plain, nervous, manly; and he could
express this with even better right than Persius, inasmuch as
his own, though extremely allusive and of the most original
character, is quite clear from involution or conceit. But he did
not care in the least to investigate literary processes: nor did
he trouble himself very much to contrast styles and differentiate
their values. One may even, without any rashness of guess, be
certain that he would have regarded criticism of form with
nearly as much disfavour in a man as he expressly does in a
woman. In fact, he would have considered it the occupation of
a fribble.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we pass to the graceful graceless crowd of motes, or
rather midges (for they have a very distinct bite), which composes
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Martial.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the works of Martial, we find, as has been
said, very much the same general attitude towards
styles in literature. But the expression is differentiated, not
merely by the existence in the writer of a different moral complexion,
but by the necessary conditions of his form. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>They</i></span>
could discuss; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>he</i></span> can only glance. Further, the avowed purpose
of amusement, of composing the verses of a very peculiar
society, which animates the epigrams practically throughout,
affects the result very considerably. Their author resembles
both Persius and Juvenal in paying very elaborate attention to
the outside of things, to the accidents of the literary business.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>We hear in him continually the echo of the <i>sophos</i>, the “bravo!”
which the reciter and the rhetorician sought for, and which they
sometimes, if not often, procured by the agency of a regular
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>claque</i></span>. We learn (not in the least to our surprise) that then,
as now, there existed the kind literary friend who was quite
eager to receive presentation copies, but who was by no means
ready to go to the publishers and exchange even an extremely
moderate number of his own denarii for a nice clean book, on
polished vellum and neatly rubricated.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c008'><sup>[323]</sup></a> There were also then,
as now, readers or reviewers who would take copyists’ (<i>lege</i>
“printers’”) errors very seriously, and upbraid the poet for
them<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c008'><sup>[324]</sup></a>—which he did not bear patiently.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here we have the certainly pointed, if not very polite, excuse
for not submitting to the same tax of presentation copies, that
he fears his friend may reply with a present of <em>his</em> works:<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c008'><sup>[325]</sup></a>
elsewhere (in those triumphs of ingenious trifling the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>apophoreta</i></span>,
or gift-tickets) the neat suggestion, with a blank album, that
a poet can offer no more acceptable present than paper <em>not</em>
written upon.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c008'><sup>[326]</sup></a> In one place there is, to carry off a piece of
sheer begging, an irresistibly comic anecdote of a “curious
impertinent,” who after asking whether the poet is not the
Martial whom everybody not a fool admires, and receiving a
confession of the soft impeachment, abruptly demands why
such a poet has such a shocking bad great-coat, and receives
the meek reply, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quia sum malus poeta</i></span>.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c008'><sup>[327]</sup></a> But these, and a good
many others, which an easy reading, and a not very troublesome
classification, of the <cite>Epigrams</cite> will enable any one to produce,
are examples parallel rather to our citations from Juvenal than
to the capital one from Persius. That is to say, they are examples
rather of the selection of a particular subject, as one of a
hundred suitable to the special mode of treatment, than of
the assertion or the display of any particular interest in that
subject, or any special theories upon it. So, too, in some cases
of more special reference, Martial’s habits of flattery, and the
unblushing way in which (not for the first or the last time)
men of letters in his generation were wont to fish for presents,
make it not always quite easy to know how much seriousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>to attach to his expressions of opinion on particular writers.
Did he, for instance, really think Silius Italicus such a great
poet?<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c008'><sup>[328]</sup></a> One cannot say: it is certain that Silius was rich,
and a person who seems to have been able to keep his head
above water, and on his shoulders, during all the stormy changes
of his lifetime. And if such a man wrote poetry, if he was
not his enemy—still more if, as was the case here, he was his
friend—we know but too well that Marcus Valerius Martialis
was never likely to <em>publish</em> any unflattering opinion of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, in a very large number of cases, there was no possibility
of hoodwinking, nor any object in attempting the operation. In
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The style of the Epigrams.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the very numerous references to his own books,
Martial shows us that he wrote, not at haphazard
but with the keenest critical knowledge of the
requirements of the form. That he recognises, in more places
than one,<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c008'><sup>[329]</sup></a> Catullus as his own master, model, and superior, is
itself a critical document and testimonial of the first value. For
it is notorious that the Romans, as a rule, by no means rated
the great poet of Verona at his due; and though the sneer
of Horace<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c008'><sup>[330]</sup></a> may have been dictated by a sufficiently ignoble
but very intelligible jealousy, the slight and passing note of
Quintilian<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c008'><sup>[331]</sup></a> admits of no such explanation. But it was the
Catullus of the epigrams that Martial endeavoured to rival.
In doing so he shows that he had a very definite, and a very
just, notion of the versification and diction necessary to his
purpose. His praise of the <cite>Romana simplicitas</cite> shown in the
style of the lampoon of Augustus on Fulvia, in respect to which
one can only refer modern readers to the original,<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c008'><sup>[332]</sup></a> is capable of
being mistaken for a mere laudation of coarse language—for an
anticipation of that curious fallacy which has more than once
made men regret the withdrawal of the licence to “talk
greasily.” But this is unfair both to the poet and to the
Emperor. Martial certainly does talk greasily with a vengeance;
but the last line of this Imperial fescenninity depends for its
point by no means merely on the obscene, and is an excellent
example of clear-cut, straight-hitting phrase.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>This phrase Martial himself almost always achieved, though
in a few cases his points are still dark to us, and though he had
not the slightest objection to using Greek words, vulgar words,
and so forth when it suited his purpose. The misty magniloquence
which attracted so many men of his time had no
charms for him. When he rises, as he sometimes does, from
sheer naughtiness or playful trifling to pathos, to seriousness,
to graceful description of landscape—in the well-known Pætus
and Arria piece, in the epitaphs on Erotion, and the still finer
one on Paris, in his country poems and elsewhere—he is purely
Attic. No style can have a simpler and a less affectedly simple
grace. And that he did this deliberately—that it was his
theory as well as his practice—we may see very well from a
sort of cento of passages bearing on the subject. He differs
not merely from Catullus but from Prior (who is perhaps his
nearest analogue in almost all ways) by having obviously no
velleities towards the grand style. We can imagine Prior writing,
and writing quite as well, the piece which tells how pretty
Phyllis, when her lover was racking his brains for some elegant
present to reward her kindness past, exerted fresh coaxing
before asking him for—a jar of wine,<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c008'><sup>[333]</sup></a> or describing the singular
history of Galla on the stock- and share-lists of Love.<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c008'><sup>[334]</sup></a> But we
cannot imagine Martial writing <cite>Alma</cite> or <cite>Solomon</cite>. And all
his critical observations, direct or indirect, testify to a conception
of literature perfectly clear and not really deserving
the term narrow, if only because the poet quite frankly limits
it to the kind in which he wishes to, and knows that he can,
excel, the kind indicated in his own famous quatrain:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ille ego sum nulli nugarum laude secundus</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Quem non ignoras, sed puto lector amas:</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Sufficit in vestras sæpe redire manus.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Let us see what morsels of criticism such handling furnishes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The prose preface and the opening epigrams of the first book
contain humorous statements of his own fame, excuses (not quite
valid) for his licence of speech, and jocose exaggerations of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>critical temper of the times; but there is not much doctrine
in them. There is more in ii. 77, where, not in the best temper
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Précis of their critical contents.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
(for Martial, like some other persons, though he loved
to criticise, was not excessively fond of being criticised),
he points out to a certain Cusconius what the
French wit afterwards borrowed from him in the
phrase <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“ce n’est pas long, mais il y a des longueurs.”</span> Verses, he
says, like his own, though there may be many of them, are not
long because they can spare nothing, because there is nothing
otiose in them. Cusconius, on the other hand, can write distichs
which are long. There is a not uninteresting glance at the
fashionable literary subjects and kinds—History of the times
of Claudius, criticism of the myths about Nero (these could be
safely done under the Flavian emperors), fables in the style of
Phædrus, tender elegiacs and stern hexameters, Sophoclean
tragedy or Attic salt—in iii. 20. Another French jest—one of
the very best of Piron on La Chaussée—is anticipated with
variation in the 25th of the same book, by the suggestion to a
friend whose baths have been overheated, that he should ask
Sabinæus the rhetor to bathe. <em>He</em> can reduce the temperature
of the Thermæ of Nero themselves. IV. 49 gives us another
critical laudation of the epigram. Flaccus is quite wrong to
think it child’s play. The poet is much more guilty of that
who busies himself with Tereus and Thyestes and Dædalus and
Polyphemus. There is no mere bombast in <em>his</em> book: <em>his</em>
Muse is not frounced with senseless tragic train.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c008'><sup>[335]</sup></a> “But,” says
Flaccus, “the others are the things that people praise.” “Perhaps,”
says Martial, “they praise <em>them</em>: but they read <em>me</em>,” with
of course the implied and very sound criticism that it is not so
easy to write what shall be easy to read. V. 10 ends with a
jest, the poet saying that if his fame is to come after his death
he hopes it will come late. But it treats rather seriously the
other “touch of nature” (opposite to that of which Shakespeare
speaks and complementary to it), that in literature, and at
times [not always, O Martial!] men do <em>not</em> “praise new-born
gauds.” They read Ennius in the lifetime of Virgil, laughed at
Homer [the evidence for this?] in his own days, preferred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Philemon to Menander, and left Ovid to the appreciation of
Corinna.<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c008'><sup>[336]</sup></a> But he shows his less critical mood in setting this
down to envy rather than to the undoubted fact that, in at least
many cases, poets anticipate, if they do not exactly create, the
taste for them—that, as it has been said, a poet’s chief admirers
are born at about the time when he writes. The necessity of
some “bite”<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c008'><sup>[337]</sup></a> in epigrams, vii. 25, is counsel at least as much of
common-sense as of literature. In the 85th of the same, the
poet objects to Sabellus that he can write a few quatrains
rather well, but not a book—by which he probably glances at
the necessity, in a book, of varying and sorting the kinds, as
well as of providing a mere quantity of monotonous stuff. And
in the 90th again of the same book he is still more explicitly
argumentative. A certain Matho, it seems, went about saying
that Martial’s books were unequal. If this be so, retorts our
bard, it is because Calvinus (? or Cluvienus, as in Juvenal)
and Umber write “equal” verses, and a bad book is always an
“equal” one.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, what exactly did he mean by “equal”? When we say
that a book is unequal, we generally mean that it has faults as
well as beauties, that it is not equally good, and in this sense
Martial would merely be vindicating himself from the charge
of a tame faultlessness, from that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>æqualis mediocritas</i></span> which
Quintilian smites in passing. But, if we take it in conjunction
with the Sabellus epigram just quoted, I think it will not be
unfair to allow to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>æqualis</i></span> also its other sense of “unvarying,”
“monotonous,” and give the prominence to this in the equivalence
with <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>malus</i></span> of the last line.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c008'><sup>[338]</sup></a> Martial specially and critically
prided himself on the variety of his books, on their containing
something for every taste, and something (almost)
about every subject. And the book, he says therefore, that
has not this quality is a bad book. The same doctrine pierces
through the laudation of the prose preface of the Eighth to
Domitian, and points the hope that the celestial <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>verecundia</i></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>of the “bald Nero” will not be offended by the naughtier
epigrams.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third of this eighth book contains an interesting dialogue
between the Poet and his Muse. Were it not, says he,
better to stop? Are not six or seven books enough and too
much? Their fame is far and widely spread, and when the
monuments of the great are dust they will be, and strangers
will take them to their own country. It is never quite easy to
know whether Martial is laughing in his sleeve or not in these
boastings. But the ninth of the sisters, her hair and garments
dripping with perfume (probably Thalia, certainly not
one of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Musæ severiores</i></span>), upbraids him with ingratitude and
folly. Why drop these pleasantries? What better pastime
will he find? Will he change his sock for the buskin, or arrange
hexameters to tell of wars, that pedants may spout him,
and that good boys and fair girls may loathe his name? Let
the grave and precise write such things by their midnight
lamp. But for him, let an elegant saltness dash his Roman
books, let real living people recognise and read their own
actions and characters; and if the oat be thin, remember that
it conquers the trumpets of many. The Epigram here, it will
be seen, arrogates to itself something like the place of the full
Satire.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, one of the best and most spirited of Martial’s literary
pronouncements, is followed up in a lower key by the 56th
epigram of the same book, addressed to that Flaccus who is
elsewhere the recipient of the poet’s literary confidences. It
contains the famous line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Sint<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c008'><sup>[339]</sup></a> Mæcenates, non deerunt, Flacce, Marones”</span>—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>and elaborates the doctrine that the patron makes the poet,
comfort, if not luxury, the poetry, in an ingenious but impudent
manner, carrying off the impudence, however, by the close.
What, he supposes Flaccus to say, will you be a Virgil if I
give you what Mæcenas gave him? Well, no, perhaps: but I
may be a Marsus—a poet who wrote many things, but chiefly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>in the occasional kind, whom Martial greatly admired, and
whose epilogue on Tibullus—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Te quoque Virgilio comitem non æqua Tibulle”</span>—</div>

</div>

<p class='c019'>with two or three other fragments, we possess.<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c008'><sup>[340]</sup></a> And the same
doctrine, that love and luxury are needful to the bard, reappears
in 73.</p>

<p class='c001'>Martial does not often come down to the minutiæ of criticism,
but he sometimes does, and once in a very noteworthy
passage, ix. 11. Here, in some of his most gracefully fluttering
verses, he celebrates the charm of the name<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c008'><sup>[341]</sup></a> Eiarinos or Earinos,
notes that unless he takes the epic licence of the first form
it will not come into verse, and then adds—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Dicunt Eiarinon tamen poetæ,</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>There are two things noticeable here—first, Martial’s truly
poetical sensitiveness to the beauty of a name, for certainly
there is none prettier than Earine (let him keep the masculine
to himself!) which also appears elsewhere; and secondly his
equally poetical yearning for that licence of “common” quantification,
which has made Greek and English the two great
poetical languages of the world.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c008'><sup>[342]</sup></a> If he would have developed
these views a little oftener, and at a little greater length, we
really could have spared a considerable number of epigrams
imputing unmentionable offences to the persons he did not like.
It was his cue, however, to profess (though half his charm
comes from his sense of them) disdain for such niceties, as in
the 81st epigram of the same book, which is one of his neatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>turns. Readers, he says, and hearers like his books, but a certain
poet denies that they are correctly finished (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>exactos</i></span>). It
does not trouble him much, for he would rather that the
courses of the feast he offers pleased the guests than that they
pleased the cooks. In this, light as it is, there lurks the germ
of a weighty criticism, and one which would, had it been
worked out, have carried Martial far from the ordinary critical
standpoint of his time. That, in homely phrase analogous to
his own, the proof of the pudding is in the eating—that the
production of the poetical satisfaction afterwards, not the satisfaction
of the examiners beforehand as to the observation of
the rules, is the thing—that Martial doubtless saw, and that he,
by implication, says. But he does not say it quite openly, and
it might have shocked Quintilian (though it would not have
shocked Longinus) if he had.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Tenth book is particularly rich in literary epigrams. It
opens with a batch of them,—one of his pleasant excuses for
yet another reappearance (the pieces are so short that if you
don’t like the book you can lay it down as finished at any
moment), an honest indication of the fact that some of the
epigrams are only new editions, so to speak, of old ones,
smoothed with a recent file, one of the not disagreeably boasting
reminders that letters outlive brass and marble (a boast
justified in his own case, but not so, alas! in those of Marsus
and others whom he admitted as his masters), a strongly
worded protest against some clandestine poet who has been
forging bad epigrams in his name, a repetition of the old
contemptuous pooh-poohing of stock Greek subjects, and the
old exhortation to study the life. The 19th, in a pleasant
<i>envoy</i> of the book to Pliny, bids the Muse who carries it observe
her time, and not disturb the grave man at his graver hours.
The 21st is an expostulation with a certain Sextus, who seems
to have prided himself on the eccentric vocabulary of his
poems. What is the use of writing so that Modestus and
Claranus themselves (known men of learning) can scarcely
understand you, and so that your books demand not an ordinary
reader but the Delphic Apollo? You would prefer to
Virgil Cinna—Helvius Cinna, whose fancy for out-of-the-way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>words we can see, even in the petty wreckage of his work
that time has fated to us.<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c008'><sup>[343]</sup></a> Perhaps, Martial admits, such
poems may be praised; but he would rather have grammarians
like his work, and not be necessary to its liking.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c008'><sup>[344]</sup></a>
The 35th is a specially graceful compliment to the poetess
Sulpicia, who wrote her love poems (apparently rather warm
ones<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c008'><sup>[345]</sup></a>) to her husband only, and with whom, says Martial, for
schoolmate or schoolmistress, Sappho herself would have been
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>doctior et pudica</i></span>—a right happy blending of comparative and
positive. 70 is a quaint apology, not for writing so much but for
writing so little, the satire of which is so ingeniously airy that
it is possible to interpret its irony in more ways than one.
Potitus calls him lazy because he does not bring out more than
one book a-year. What time has a man to write poetry?
Calls and congratulations (which, somehow, he does not find
returned), attendances at religious and official functions, listening
the whole day long to other poets, to advocates, to declaimers,
to very grammarians, the bath, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sportula</i></span>—why, the
whole day slips away sometimes without one’s being able to
settle to work at all!</p>

<p class='c001'>The 78th, addressed to Macer, contains the graceful request—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nec multos mihi præferas poetas,</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>which shows Martial’s faithfulness to his exquisite master.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Eleventh and Twelfth, the last of the epigrams proper
(for the <cite>Xenia</cite> and <cite>Apophoreta</cite><a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c008'><sup>[346]</sup></a> have been dealt with so far as
the little that they have concerns us, and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Liber de Specta
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>culis</cite></span> is out of the question), are also fruitful. The common
habit of addressing the book itself at its beginning frequently
has a literary turn given to it by Martial, and as in the Tenth
so in the Eleventh, not one but a batch appears as overture,
chiefly dedicatory; while another batch farther on is opened
by the promise, certainly not falsified, that the book is going
to be the naughtiest of all. The 90th, however, is important
for us, though by no means <a id='corr266.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='inmaculate'>immaculate</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_266.8'><ins class='correction' title='inmaculate'>immaculate</ins></a></span>, because the sudden
fling of a handful of mud, in which Martial too often delights,
is led up to by satire on that same preference for uncouth and
archaic language, which, as we have seen, so often defrays the
satiric criticism of the time. Chrestillus, the victim, it seems,
approves no smooth verses; they must roll over rocks and jolt
on half-made roads to please him. A verse like</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Luceili columella heic situ’ Metrophanes”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>is better to him than all Homer, and he worships <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>terrai
frugiferai</i></span> and all the jargon of Attius and Pacuvius.</p>

<p class='c001'>The prose preface of the Twelfth book starts with an excuse
for a three years’ silence (it would appear that for a considerable
time Martial had produced a book yearly), due to the
poet’s return to Spain. He had been, as the epigram above
quoted pleads, too busy or too lazy to write in town; in the
country he found himself deprived of the material for writing.
The stimulating, teasing occupations of Rome had given place
to mere clownish vacancy. However, to please Priscus, he
has busied himself again, and he only hopes that his friend
will not find his work “not merely Spanish of the Roman Pale,
but Spanish pure and simple.”<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c008'><sup>[347]</sup></a> In the third epigram there
is a half-rueful recommendation (which Thackeray would have
translated impeccably) to his book to revisit the dear old
places, ending with a distich revindicating, in no wise foolishly,
the crown of style—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quid titulum poscis? Versus duo tresve legantur,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clamabunt omnes te, liber, esse meum.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>He was right. Nobody but Martial could have written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Martial except Catullus himself in his less noble moods; and
the boast is in itself a criticism and a just one. Yet Martial
had his dignity, and an odd epigram, the 61st of this book,
disclaims the mere coarse language in which he seems to us
too often to have indulged. And the tale of literary epigrams
ceases (I apologise for omissions in the bright and shifting
bevy) with another odd piece, which may be either gross flattery,
irony of a rather sanguinary kind, or mere playfulness,
and in which he remonstrates with his friend Tucca for touching
and executing, so as to make competition impossible, every
kind of <a id='corr267.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='poetry'>poetry.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_267.11'><ins class='correction' title='poetry'>poetry.</ins></a></span> Epic, tragedy, lyric, satire, epigram itself—Martial
has tried them all and dropped them, because he feels
himself beaten by Tucca. This is not fair; let Tucca leave
him at least one kind, the kind that he doesn’t care for. It
is not fanciful, surely, to find a critique of poetical polypragmatism
here also.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may well seem to some that too much space has been
accorded to Martial; but it has been allotted on the principle
which, be it mistaken or not, is the principle that underlies
this book. We have, in this good-for-nothing trifler, a very
considerable number of pronouncements on critical points, or
points connected with criticism, and, what is more, we have in
him a writer who has a very clear notion of literary criticism
in and for his own work. A great poet Martial is not: he
has no fine madness, or only the remotest touches of it. He
does not look back to the way in which Lucretius had infused
that quality into the language; I do not think, speaking under
correction, that he ever so much as names him. He does not
anticipate (and if he had anticipated, he would not, I think,
have welcomed with any pleasure) the tide which, welling in
upon the severer Muses of classical Latin style, gave them
once more the Siren quality in the Low Latin of the Middle
Ages. Farther, he can hardly be said to have any “wood-notes
wild”; even his country descriptions, charming as they are,
are distinctly artificial. Much as he adores Catullus, it is not
for the flashes of pure poetry which we see in that poet. But,
on the other hand, Martial sees, not merely with instinctive
but with critical certainty, that gift of precision, clearness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>felicity, <i>venustas</i>, which the Greek-Latin blend of the Golden
and Silver Ages had. He practises and he preaches the cultivation
of this. He preaches it at no tedious length: his
chosen form as well as his common-sense would have prevented
that. But he directly extols the cultivation of style—of that
quality which will make any decent judge identify a poet
when he has heard three lines of his poem. And he practises
what he preaches. Even what the grave and precise (quite
truly one must confess) call his moral degradation saves him
from confusing the moral with the literary quality of literature—the
noble error of most ancient criticism. He has, as scarcely
any other ancient writer has, formulated the great critical
question, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“L’ouvrage est-il bon ou est-il mauvais?”</span> And if
he had chosen to write a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Arte Poetica</cite></span>, I am bound, shocking
as the confession may seem, to say that I think it would
have been superior to that of Horace, while he has provided
no unimportant <i>progymnasmata</i> towards one as it is.</p>

<p class='c001'>From “the mixed and subtle Martial,” as Gavin Douglas excellently
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Statius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
calls him, we may pass to the poet, perhaps the rival,
whom he never mentions<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c008'><sup>[348]</sup></a>—the author of that only adequate
Roman description of Lucretius which has been referred to
above.<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c008'><sup>[349]</sup></a> The precise sources of the popularity of Statius in the
Middle Ages have never yet, I think, been thoroughly investigated.
It is, however, not difficult to discern them
afar off, and to include among them a certain touch of that
uncritical quality which, as we shall see, was one
of the main notes of the Middle Ages themselves.
Yet the author of the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>furor arduus Lucreti</i></span><a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c008'><sup>[350]</sup></a>
must have been able at least to appreciate. And the poem
which contains that phrase, as well as the prose prefaces of
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Sylvæ</cite></span> where it occurs, will yield something more bearing
on our subject. The first of these prefaces is a curious if not
particularly felicitous plea for the legitimacy—indeed, for the
necessity—of a poet’s indulging in lighter work in the intervals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>of <cite>Thebaids</cite> and <cite>Achilleids</cite>. This is something like the view of
Pliny: the poet must be a Jack-of-all-poetical-trades. Martial
knew better. But it is a noteworthy thing (and Martial himself
would have been pungent on it) that Statius cannot make his
trifles brief. Domitian’s horse has nearly three hundred lines.
I do not think that there is a single poem in the five books of
the <cite>Sylvæ</cite> which falls short of several scores, whatever its metre.
In the preface of the second he apologises to his friend Melior
for some of the pieces, as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>libellos quasi epigrammatic loco
scriptos</i></span>, and here again Martial might have had something to
say about epigrams seventy-seven lines long. That Statius had
not cleared up his own mind about criticism appears from the
touching and attractive, though not quite consummate, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ad
Claudiam Uxorem</cite></span>, where the poet, beaten in the public competitions
where he had long triumphed, proposes that Naples,
and his wife’s caresses, shall console him for the loss of tasteless
and thankless Rome. But the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Genethliacon Lucani</cite></span>, a commemorative
birth-day poem on Lucan (which would have been
a little more effective if we could forget that this tribute to
the victim of Nero was written by a flatterer of Domitian),
contains the central utterance of Statius about other poets. It
is, as nearly everything of Statius has been said to be, too long
and too much improvised, though also, like most things, if not
everything, of his, it contains fine touches, especially that of
Lucan in the shades:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Seu magna sacer et superbus umbra</span></div>

      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Matris lampade respicis Neronem.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>But its interest for us, besides the Lucretian description, which
is itself not improved by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>docti</i></span>, consists in the long eulogy of
Lucan himself, and the repeated, and therefore not probably
conventional, advice to him not to be afraid of Virgil—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>It would be clear from this, if we did not know it from the evidence
of his original work, that Statius was not on the side of
the satirists, that he had no objection to the Spanish <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>ampulla</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The, in all ways very delightful, Epistles<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c008'><sup>[351]</sup></a> of the younger
Pliny are not least delightful in the line of literary criticism.
<span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pliny the Younger: Criticism on the Letters.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Pliny was a confirmed man of letters. In no member
of the most interesting group of late Flavian and
early Antonine writers do we see more clearly the
“bookish” tone which so largely pervaded Roman
society. He even, on the celebrated occasion<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c008'><sup>[352]</sup></a> when he tells
Tacitus with modest pride that he had bagged three wild boars,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>et quidem pulcherrimos</i></span>, admits that he sat at the nets with a
pencil and a notebook, thus anticipating the action of Kingsley’s
Lancelot Smith when he took St Francis de Sales to a meet.
He takes an intelligent pride in his uncle’s literary work, and
if he is a little wrong in doubting Martial’s power of “lasting”
in the letter which he writes after his death,<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c008'><sup>[353]</sup></a> let us remember
that Martial had paid him a very pretty compliment (which he
quotes and which we have quoted<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c008'><sup>[354]</sup></a>), and that it would not have
done to be too certain of the fact of this coming to Prince
Posterity. The very first letter<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c008'><sup>[355]</sup></a> admits a particular critical
care in composition, and the second gives further particulars
thereof. He had never taken such care as with the book that
he sends to Arrian. He had tried to follow Demosthenes and
Calvus, but few, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quos æquus amavit</i></span> (this allusiveness would
have been reprehended by some of our modern critics), can
really catch up such masters. The matter was good, and he
had sometimes ventured to extract special ornaments from the
“perfume-bottles”<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c008'><sup>[356]</sup></a> of Cicero. But Arrian must give him a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>careful revision, for the booksellers tell him that the thing is
already popular. He has many of the technical phrases which
half attract and half repel modern readers, because they are
so difficult to adjust. There is something like a miniature
review in his description of the works of Pompeius Saturninus
to Erucius in i. 16. This Pompey has something so
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>varium</i></span>, so <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>flexibile</i></span>, so <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>multiplex</i></span>, that he holds Pliny’s entire
attention. He had heard him pleading both with and without
preparation, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>acriter et ardenter, nec minus polite et ornate</i></span>. There
were in these speeches <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>acutæ, crebræque sententiæ</i></span>, a grave
and decorous construction, sonorous and archaic terms (Martial
and Persius would have shaken heads). “All these things,”
he says, “please strangely when they are rolled forth in a
rushing flood, and they please even if they are read over
again. You will think as I do when you have his orations
in your hands, orations comparable to those of any of the
ancients whom he rivals. Yet he is still more satisfactory
in History, whether you take his brevity, or his light, or his
sweetness, or his splendour, or his sublimity. In popular
addresses he is the same as in Oratory, though more compressed
and circumscript, and wound together. His verses are as good
as Catullus or Calvus, and full of elegance, sweetness, bitterness,
love! and his Letters (which he calls his wife’s) are like
Plautus or Terence without the metre.” Truly an Admirable
Crichton of a Pompeius Saturninus! and great pity it is that
he has not come down to us, this “Cambridge the everything”<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c008'><sup>[357]</sup></a>—of
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>circa</i></span> 100 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span></p>

<p class='c001'>But the most famous of Pliny’s letters in connection with
this subject is the twentieth of the first book,<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c008'><sup>[358]</sup></a> to Tacitus, in
which he deals with a set question of literary criticism. “A
certain learned and skilful man” maintains that in oratory
brevity is everything. In certain cases, Pliny admits, but
only in certain cases. The adversary objects Lysias among
the Greeks, the Gracchi and Cato among the Romans. Pliny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>retorts with Demosthenes, Æschines, Hyperides, Pollio, Cæsar,
Cælius, Cicero. Indeed he does not fear to lay it down as a
general principle, “the bigger the better.”<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c008'><sup>[359]</sup></a> The adversary says
that the orators spoke less than they published. Pliny dissents.
And then he discusses the matter generally—from the point of
view of oratory in the main, but partly also from that of literature.
And his general view, like that of his generation (I hardly
know whether to include his master Quintilian or not), may be
taken as put in the phrase, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Non enim amputata oratio et
abscissa, sed lata et magnifica et excelsa tonat, fulgurat, omnia
denique perturbat ac miscet</i></span>.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c008'><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The third letter of the second book is a set panegyric
of Isæus,<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c008'><sup>[361]</sup></a> which would be of more interest if criticisms of
orators were not so common; the fifth of the third is the
notice of the life, literary and other, of Pliny the Elder. The
obituary criticism of Martial, to which reference has been
made, occurs in the 21st of this third book, and is a little
patronising. But the contemner of brevity, even if he were
a private friend and a flattered one, and if he had (as most
Romans would have had) no objection to Martial’s freedom of
subject and language, could hardly be expected to do full justice
to the epigrammatist.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are less able to judge the literary part of the flattering
epistle (iv. 3) to Antoninus, afterwards Emperor, which
is so much in the extravagant style of Roman compliment that,
in the absence of the work referred to, it gives us no critical
information whatever. The literary characteristic of the future
Pius appeared to Pliny to be the mixture of the severe with the
agreeable—of the grave with the gay, which made his style
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>extraordinary sweet, as the eighteenth century would have said.
The usual honey and its maker-bees put in the usual appearance
to express Pliny’s sensations when he reads his correspondent’s
Greek epigrams and iambics. He thinks of
Callimachus or Herodes (doubtless our just recovered
Herondas). Only neither has done anything so humane, so
venust, so sweet, so loving, so keen, so correct. How could a
Roman write such Greek? It is more Attic than Athens, and
Pliny grudges such a writer to the Greeks, though there is no
doubt that if Antoninus would only write in his mother tongue
he would do better still.</p>

<p class='c001'>IV. 14, enclosing some hendecasyllabics which have not come
down (from other specimens they are a tolerable loss), contains
some interesting and curious remarks on the always burning
and never yet settled question of morality in literature. Pliny
adopts to the full, as a matter of principle, the doctrine which
his friend Martial had both practised and preached, that naughty
things, and even the naughtiest words, may figure in poetry,—that,
as Pliny himself puts it, with the still higher authority of
Catullus—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nam castum esse decet pium poetam</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ipsum—versiculos nihil necesse est.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Only he himself declines to use the naughty words,<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c008'><sup>[362]</sup></a> not out of
prudery, but out of timidity. He follows this up with the
sounder doctrine that everything must be judged in its own
kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another short letter to Antoninus (iv. 18) not merely repeats
the praise of his Greek epigrams, but informs us that Pliny himself
has put some of these in Latin. A longer one, which follows, to
Calpurnia Hispulla, contains an elaborate eulogy of the lady’s
niece, Pliny’s second wife, who shows her good taste and virtue
by learning her husband’s books by heart, instructing herself
in literature generally for love of him, and singing his verses.
And later, with something of the same innocence or lack of
humour which was a Roman—in fact, has generally been a
Latin—characteristic, he tells us that he has been for three days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>listening <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cum summa voluptate</i></span> to a certain Sentius Augurinus,
reciting his poems or poemkins (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>poematia</i></span>). Sentius, it seems,
performed many things with lightness, many with sublimity,
many with beauty, many with tenderness, many with sweetness,
many <em>with bile</em>. It is not quite clear under which head comes
the specimen he produces, which is a rather feeble compliment
to Pliny himself. “Vides,” says Pliny, after quoting it, “quam
acuta omnia, quam apta, quam expressa.” Besides, he is the
friend of Spurinna and Antoninus. What an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>emendatus
adolescens</i></span>!</p>

<p class='c001'>V. 8<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c008'><sup>[363]</sup></a> is a not uninteresting paper on History. Tutinius
Capito wishes him, as he tells us others had done, to write this.
Pliny is not ill-disposed to do so, not because he thinks he
shall do it very well, but (the sentiment is a fine one, though a
little bombastically expressed) because “it seems to him one of
the best of actions to rescue from perishing that which ought to
be eternal.”<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c008'><sup>[364]</sup></a> His idea of history, however, is not very lofty.
Oratory and Poetry, he says, must have style; History pleases
howsoever it be written, because of the natural curiosity of
man—a doctrine which, in slightly changed matter, has been
joyfully accepted by the usual novelist. Besides, his uncle had
been a diligent historian. Then why does he delay? Because
he wants to execute a careful recension of his speeches in
important cases, and he hardly feels equal to both tasks, while,
though there is much in common between Oratory and History,
they are also different. The contrast is curious, and shows the
overweening position which Oratory had with the ancients. To
History, says Pliny, things humble and sordid, or at least
mediocre, belong: to Oratory, all that is exquisite, splendid, and
lofty.<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c008'><sup>[365]</sup></a> The bare bones, muscles, and nerves suit history:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Oratory must have the swelling bulk of flesh and the waving
plumes of hair. History pleases by rough, bitter energy:<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c008'><sup>[366]</sup></a>
Oratory by long-drawn sweetness. Diction, style, construction—all
are different. After which he gives a somewhat unexpected
turn to the famous Thucydidean saying, by admitting
that history is the <i>ktema</i>, and the <i>agonisma</i> oratory. And,
therefore, he thinks that he had better not attempt at once
two things so different. A letter to Suetonius about the
books of both (v. 10), another to Spurinna (v. 17) about a
recitation by Calpurnius Piso, a third (vi. 15) on a thin jest
by Javolenus Priscus at another recitation by a descendant
of Propertius (who began “Prisce jubes,” and was interrupted
by Javolenus, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ego vero non jubeo</i></span>), may be glanced at rather
than discussed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps there is no better document of Pliny’s literary
criticism, both in its strength and in its weakness, than vi. 17.
He writes in a state of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>indignatiuncula</i></span> (let us translate “mild
wrath”), which he can only relieve by working it off in a letter
to his friend Restitutus. He has been at one of the eternal
recitations, where the book recited was not so usual; indeed,
it was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>absolutissimus</i></span>—quite “A per se,” as our ancestors
would have said. But one or two of the audience (clever<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c008'><sup>[367]</sup></a>
fellows, as they and a few others thought) listened to it as if
they were deaf mutes. They did not open their lips: they did
not clap: they did not even rise from their seats save when
they were tired of sitting. What is the good of such gravity,
such wisdom, nay, such laziness, arrogance, <em>sinisterity</em> (a good
word!), or, to cut things short, madness, which leads men to
spend a whole day [the terrors of recitation were obviously not
exaggerated by the satirists] in offending and making an enemy
of a man whom you have visited as a friend? Are you clever?
Do not show envy: the envier is the lesser. Nay, whether you
can yourself do as well, or less well, all the same praise him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>whether he be inferior or superior or equal. Your superior,
because, if he is not praiseworthy, still less are you; your
equal or inferior, because the better he is, in that case, the
better you are. Pliny, for his part, is wont to venerate and
admire anybody who does anything in literature. It is a
difficult thing, sir, an arduous, a fastidious, and it has a
knack of bringing scorn on those who scorn it.<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c008'><sup>[368]</sup></a> Restitutus
will surely agree: he is the most amiable and considerate of
judges. We may mark this passage as, of many interesting
ones, that which gives us Pliny’s measure as a literary critic
best.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the list of his noteworthy “places” is by no means
closed. VI. 21 gives us his standpoint in another famous
quarrel—that of Ancients and Moderns. He admires the
former, but by no means so as to despise the latter. He does
not hold with the doctrine of the senescence of nature. He
recently heard Vergilius Romanus recite a comedy in the Old
Comedy kind, which was as good as it could be. The same
man has written mimiambics with perfect grace, comedies
in another kind as good as Menander’s; he has force, grandeur,
subtlety, bitterness, sweetness, neatness, he glorifies virtue,
attacks vice, invents his personages,<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c008'><sup>[369]</sup></a> and uses real ones, with
equal appropriateness. And (as by this time we begin to
expect in such cases) “In writing about <em>me</em> he has only
gone wrong by excessive kindness; and, after all, poets may
feign.” One sees that the excellent Pliny’s geese were swans
in every quill.</p>

<p class='c001'>VII. 4 deals at some length with his own poems, and gives
some hexameters about Tiro and Cicero, which are in style
quite worthy of the subject. There are some elegiacs (rather
better) in vii. 8, which is an elaborate recommendation of
literary study—the turning of Greek into Latin, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>,
the refashioning and rearrangement of work already done,
the alternation of oratorical practice with history, letter-writing,
and verse of the lighter kind, which receives an
elaborate and not unhappy encomium. As for reading, read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>all the best models in all the styles in which you write.
VII. 17 is on recitation; 20 of the same book is one of
several interesting, though slightly amusing, letters to Tacitus,
in which Pliny implies it to be his own opinion, and quotes
it as that of others, that he and Tacitus were the two greatest
literary men of Rome, and that it was quite wonderful that
they were such friends. What Tacitus thought of the conjunction
we do not know; he was probably too well bred
a man to put his thought in words, though a Tacitean expression
of it would indeed be a treasure. In vii. 25 we
meet another “swan,” Terentius Junior, who writes things
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quam tersa omnia! quam Latina! quam Græca!</i></span> Later, in
the 30th, a friend having compared his work, in vindication
of Helvidius Priscus, to that of Demosthenes against Midias,
he confesses that he had had the piece in view, though he thinks
it would have been <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>improbum et pæne furiosum</i></span> to have imagined
rivalry possible. In viii. 4 he encourages the friend
to write an epic poem in Greek on the Dacian war, thereby
incurring a considerable responsibility. The descendant of
Propertius, on whom Javolenus Priscus made that surpassing
joke, recurs in ix. 22 with fresh praise; and the last literary
letter of importance (the 26th of the same) is on what may
be called the grand style in oratory.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, as elsewhere, there may no doubt be room for difference
of opinion as to the space and importance allowed
to our witnesses. From the point of view of this book, however,
Pliny’s testimony is of the utmost importance. We
may regret—I certainly do—that an equal abundance of
documents of the same character has not come to us from
some one of greater literary competence—from Aristotle, or
even from Dionysius, from Longinus, or even from Quintilian.
But this is distinctly a case where the better is enemy to
the good. For the purpose of ascertaining what was the actual
state of critical opinion and literary taste at a given time, it
is of more value to possess such a collection as this of Pliny’s
than to have fifty <cite>Arts of Poetry</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us “write off” liberally at the outset for the drawbacks
of the document. Pliny’s Letters, pleasant as they are, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>not free from a suspicion, and, considering some statements
of their own, something more than a suspicion, of being not entirely
spontaneous: they were, at any rate in some cases, evidently
written for publication. The author himself, though a man
of excellent learning, of the completest cultivation of his day,
of wide and ardent literary interests, and of no little common-sense,
was, as some of his quoted judgments will have shown,
not quite sufficiently possessed of the finest or most discriminating
literary judgment. Moreover, he had a somewhat
omnivorous and disproportionate opinion of the value of literary
work, merely as such, even merely as something that
looked such—compilation, translation, copying verse and prose,
what not. Further, in these characteristics he to a great
extent reflected those of his time—a time of great and active
attention to literature, but rather one of talent than of genius,
a period of decadence in many respects, and hardly of resurrection
in any, and lastly, a period of doubtful literary taste,
inclining, when it was sincere, to the florid and Asiatic, when
it affected superiority, to a forced Pseudo-Atticism and
concinnity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet it will readily be perceived that none of these allowances
is damning to the individual, while most of them even
increase his value as a representative of the period itself.
That he was, and was regarded by the time itself as, one
of the most eminent of contemporary men of letters, cannot
reasonably be doubted, though he certainly yokes himself
rather unequally with Tacitus. And he is none the worse
witness that, though a generous admirer of antiquity, he
avowedly was by no means so out of conceit with his own
time as men of letters often are. That this age was no decrepit
one need hardly be said—with Persius “dead ere
his prime,” and Martial, Juvenal, Quintilian, Tacitus, Statius,
and Pliny himself, in full flourishing, with Marcus Aurelius
and Arrian coming, with Lucian and Apuleius not far off—to
mention no others—it had something considerable to
show and say for itself. If we can obtain anything like a
clear view of its opinions on literary criticism (to which it
was naturally inclined, as being itself not of the very first,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>and having pasts of the very first behind it), we shall not
do ill. And Pliny gives us help of a very special kind, and
in very abundant degree, for the attainment of such a view,
which we may proceed to take, after noticing briefly the only
other documents of the time which require notice for our
purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are the Apocrypha<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c008'><sup>[370]</sup></a> of Quintilian, which are, for
more reasons than one, best regarded apart from the <cite>Institutes</cite>.
There are, in the first place, the <cite>Declamations</cite>, already
referred to<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c008'><sup>[371]</sup></a>—nineteen complete, with sketches, fragments,
and skeletons of a much larger number, which even
thus falls short of the huge total of nearly four hundred
assigned to him after a fashion. If the whole were written
on the scale of the score that we possess, they would fill
some four thousand closely printed pages. Interesting, in a
fashion, they are; as pointed out above, they supply, with
the works of the elder Seneca, our only considerable bodies
in Latin of that work of the schools which for centuries
occupied the growing intellects of the two great ancient literary
nations, and which supplied the never-blunted point
of the satirist’s</p>

<p class='c021'>Seneca has been treated already in his proper place. The
Pseudo-Quintilian (for there is hardly a page of the <cite>Declamations</cite>
which does not fly in the face of the <cite>Institutes</cite>) gives
us speeches, adjusted to the strict canons of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>status</i></span> and the
rest, written in the well-known style of the Ciceronian superlative
(one wonders that, simply to save breath and time,
the bar of Rome did not agree that any one who said <i>-issimus</i>
should be sconced an amphora, or, if that seem excessive, at
least a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>congius</i></span>), extremely ingenious now and then, but of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>most fantastic and arbitrary quality. The chief interest of
them, at least from our point of view, is, that in the mere
reading one understands how impossible it was that attention
to such things should consist with attention to true literary
criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dialogus de Claris Oratoribus</cite></span>, traditionally ascribed to
Tacitus, though some will have it to be nothing less than the
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Dialogus de Claris Oratoribus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
otherwise lost <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Causis corruptæ Eloquentiæ</cite></span> which
Quintilian, as we know from himself, certainly
wrote, is a much more meritorious performance.
The style is very unlike<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c008'><sup>[372]</sup></a> that of the surely unmistakable
author of the <cite>Germania</cite> and the <cite>Annals</cite>, the method does
not seem, to me at least, after a good deal of study of Quintilian,
to be his. But it is very likely about their date, and
by no contemptible author. The opening certainly chimes in
not ill with the title of Quintilian’s missing treatise. A certain
Justus Falinus had asked why, after the magnificent
crops of oratory which former ages had yielded, the very
name of <em>orator</em> had almost died out, and had been supplanted
by “counsel”<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c008'><sup>[373]</sup></a> and “advocate” and “patron.” The author
replies, with a due Ciceronianism, that he had better rub up
his memory of a remarkable conversation on the subject heard
in his youth. Curiatius Maternus, both poet and orator, had
recited a tragedy on Cato which excited the town nearly as
much as another piece of the same name sixteen hundred
years later; and Marcus Aper, a man of Gaulish origin, consular
rank, and great fame, and Julius Secundus, met (with the
writer) at Maternus’ house to talk over it. The first of these
rather despised literature, relying on mother-wit; the second
was said to be indebted more to art than to nature: but both
were among the leading counsel of their day. Secundus gently
suggests that Cato is a dangerous subject, and Maternus says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>that he has another tragedy in hand (<cite>Thyestes</cite>) with which
to follow it. Then Aper opens fire upon him: first, for
deserting oratory and the bar for idle play-writing; secondly,
for choosing foolish fancy subjects like Thyestes. Maternus
appeals to Secundus. He is accustomed to Aper’s denunciations
of poetry. Will not Secundus act as judge? Secundus
says that he is not quite impartial because of his friendship for
Saleius Bassus (a contemporary epic poet of whom we hear in
Quintilian as a particular friend of his). Oh, says Aper, let
Bassus and others, who cannot compass oratory, cultivate poetry
if they like. Here is Maternus who can: so he is wasting his
time. And he embarks on a warm and by no means ineloquent
eulogy of eloquence from its practical side, urging not merely
its great political importance but other points. Eloquence
opens positions of opulence and power, makes you valuable to
your friends and the State, is a safeguard to yourself, gives
fame, wealth, dignity. As for poetry, it brings none of these
things. It is of no use, and the pleasure it gives is short, idle,
and unprofitable. What is the good of it? Who thinks much
even of Bassus himself? And if he or his friends are in any
difficulty, to whom will they go? Why, to an orator. The
poet spends an infinity of labour on his poem, compasses
heaven and earth to whip an audience together, and gets
nothing from it. Certainly Vespasian did give Bassus five
hundred sestertia, and very noble it was of him; but this was
mere alms. An orator <em>earns</em> his money. Besides, your poets
have to skulk in the country, and even if they stay in town,
who cares about them, or goes to see them? Of course, as
before said, if a man cannot be an orator, why, let him be a
poet. But eloquence is as great a thing from the merely
literary point of view, and far more useful.</p>

<p class='c001'>Maternus takes this diatribe quite coolly, and replies readily
enough. He has had some little experience, he says, and
some little fame in both oratory and poetry: he does not care
for the publicity (so precious to Aper) which the former brings,
and, holding the contrary opinion to his friend’s, he thinks the
country life far higher and better than that of the town. The
great poets of old, if you reckon mere fame, are at least the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>equals of the orators, and (here we come to another point of
contact with Quintilian) there are more nowadays who run
down Cicero than Virgil. The unquiet and anxious life of the
orator has no charms for him. He wants neither more money
nor more power: and he would have himself figured on his
tomb, not serious and frowning, but merry and crowned. At
the peroration of Maternus comes in Vipsanius<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c008'><sup>[374]</sup></a> Messalla, who,
being informed by Secundus of the nature of the dispute,
expresses his approval of it, but hints a strong preference for
the <em>older</em> orators. Aper catches this up rather hotly, after his
manner: and after a little general conversation puts the obvious
<i>aporia</i>, Who <em>are</em> the old orators? running over the history of
Roman oratory, with some not uninteresting criticisms, and a
strong contention in favour of his own contemporaries. Maternus
and Messalla take up the same matter from other sides, and
the dialogue ends.</p>

<p class='c001'>This piece at first promises considerably, and it cannot be
said to perform badly in any place; but its conclusion and
middle part are of less importance to us than seemed likely
at the beginning. The panegyrics of Oratory and Poetry respectively,
in which Aper and Maternus indulge, might well have
led to a fuller and more searching analysis of the respective
literary merits of the two—instead of which we have from
Aper only a rather Philistine exaltation of the superior use
and profit of oratory, from Maternus a generous, but slightly
vague and rhetorical, exaltation of the qualities of poetry and
the delights of the poet. From the entrance of Messalla the
piece becomes little more than a contribution to the everlasting
ancient-and-modern quarrel on the one hand, and to the
history of Roman oratory on the other. Yet in Aper, at least,
we have a vigorous projection of the positive Roman spirit,
combined with a fancy for pregnant and precious style; in
Maternus, an indication of that mainly dilettante and bookish
temper which the satirists blame in their literary, and especially
their poetical, contemporaries; and in Messalla (who is taken by
the partisans of the Tacitean authorship to represent Tacitus
himself), an instance of that looking back to better times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>which is, at any rate sometimes, if not invariably, a token of
literary decadence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here again, as in the case of Cicero, it is necessary to break
the rule of not entering upon controversy, lest by silence one
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Mr Nettleship’s estimate of it.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
incur the blame of neglecting more than competent
authority. As in that other case, Mr Nettleship’s
estimate of the critical value of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dialogus</cite></span> (which
he unhesitatingly attributes to Tacitus) is higher, though not
so much higher, than mine. He ranks it with, but above, the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Brutus</cite></span>, as “the two great documents of Latin criticism”: I
should put both as such (though Cicero and Tacitus were both
of them far cleverer than Quintilian) below the <cite>Institutes</cite>, and
also below other things.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reason of the difference somewhat consoles me for the
fact. Mr Nettleship was evidently bitten with that noble error,
the belief that criticism of literature must be criticism of something
that is <em>not</em> literature. Tacitus seems to him to ask
“under what social conditions great writing and great speaking
arise,”—a most interesting question, but an excursus from criticism
proper. “He sees clearly, and this is the important point
which characterises the treatise, that literature must be taken
and judged as the expression of national life, not as a matter of
form and of scholastic teaching.”</p>

<p class='c001'>For “scholastic teaching” so be it: that also is extraneous to
the central matter. But on the other point one must throw
away the scabbard. Never will literature be judged adequately—seldom
will it be, even within limits, judged accurately—as
“an expression of national life.” From this and kindred
fallacies come, and always have come, a brood of monsters,
the folly, almost as great as its opposite, that “a poet must
be a good man,” the folly that you can judge literature by
remembering that there is much water-meadow in England<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c008'><sup>[375]</sup></a>—hundreds
of others. That literature is an expression of
national life nobody need deny—that national life can never
be estimated without an estimate of literature is, if anything,
still more true. But literature is first of all literature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>and it must be judged, like all other things, by the
laws of its essence, and not by the laws of even its inseparable
accidents.</p>

<p class='c001'>How different was Mr Nettleship’s point of view may be
judged from the mere fact that he actually passes over the
first fifteen chapters, which to me seem to contain most of
the literary criticism of the piece. Nor can I (though he
himself fully admits the oratorical preoccupation both here
and still more in Cicero) help thinking that the substitution
of the English “style” for “eloquentia” and “oratio” amounts
to a certain begging of the question. Much that is true of the
orator is no doubt also true of the writer, but not all: and the
connection with life, with public national life, on which such
stress is here laid, undoubtedly applies to oratory, whether
of the pulpit, the senate-house, or the bar, far more than it
applies to books. The most <em>literary</em> side of oratory (I am
not ashamed to make the concession) is the lowest—that of
pure epideictic. But then, that is because oratory is, after
all, only applied, not pure literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>We see, then, from this interesting piece, almost as much as
from the poets and Pliny, that the age was, so to say, poly-historic
<span class='sni side12'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The general literary taste of the Silver Age.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
rather than original, and that, while it was
no stranger to the very sound opinion that the
goodness of a thing must be measured in its own
kind, it still had not cleared up its mind about the
relative value of different kinds. Although oratory had, with
the rarest exceptions, become the mere art of the advocate,
or the mere business of the travelling or resident rhetorician,
it still had a most disproportionate position. Although the
satirist laughed at the custom of writing artificial Greek epics
and tragedies, it is clear that these still held the highest place
in the general opinion. The bilingual practice, not merely in
these but in other kinds, of itself inferred a certain lack of
“race,” vernacularity, genuineness, in either literature. Some
kinds of letters were still hardly known; Pliny’s own indulgent
reference to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fabellæ</i></span> is all the more interesting that we are not
so very far from the <cite>Lucius</cite> and the <cite>Golden Ass</cite>. In almost all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>departments odd conventions and assumptions prevailed, such
as the necessity of loose subjects, and even of coarse language, in
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>vers de société</i></span>. And it was probably the working of this, and of
the strict ideas as to certain forms and their laws, that caused
the jack-of-all-trade tendency to which we have more than
once referred. If the rules are pretty clearly laid down, and if
you are a man of reasonable learning and intelligence, attention
to such rules will secure success. There is no reason why
as Pliny himself seems to have thought in his own case and
the cases of many of his friends, you should not be at once an
orator and a historian, an epic poet and a comic, a dramatist
and an epigram-writer. And the age still believed devoutly
in the rules, though free-lances like Martial might kick at
them in verse, and though Quintilian, with his unfailing good
sense, might hint that there were far too many Figures, and
that the subdivisions of Greek rhetoric were in many cases
idle.</p>

<p class='c001'>In nothing, perhaps, is this tendency of ancient criticism
better shown than in its attitude to the question of Faultlessness.
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Faultlessness.</i>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Of course, on this question there were two
parties, with many subdivisions in each. There were
the extreme classics of that classic time, the wooden persons of
whom Martial tells us, for whom it was enough if a thing was
not “correct,” to whom a fault was a fault—indelible, incompensable,
to be judged off-hand and Draconically. And at the
other side there were the sensible persons, like Quintilian, like
Pliny, like Martial himself (not to mention Longinus, whom
some would have to be their contemporary), who contended that
faults might be made up by beauties, who sneered at <em>mere</em>
“faultlessness.” But no one, not Longinus himself, seems to
have taken up the position which the boldest and most consistent
(it would be question-begging to say the best) modern critics
take, that the whole calculus is wrong—that this notion of
“faults” made up by “beauties,” of a balance-sheet, debtor and
creditor, with the result struck one way or the other, is wholly
a misconception. Two, I suppose, of the most representative
passages in English poetry touching this subject are Lear’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>apostrophe to the elements, and Milton’s episode of Sin and
Death. The extreme stop-watch and foot-rule critics of the
first century, like those of the eighteenth, and, perhaps, some
(though they are not a prevailing party) even at the present day
would call these undoubted faults, both of them sinning against
the law or conception of measure in language, and the second
offending still more gravely against that or those of decency,
propriety, the becoming, in imagery, subject, language. The
defenders, or those who might have been the defenders, of
Shakespeare and Milton, from the other point of view, would
admit in varying degrees that the things were faulty; but
would urge the pathos of the first, the gloomy magnificence
of the second, the force and power and grandeur of both, as
<em>redeeming</em> them—in a degree and to an extent again varying
with the individual critic.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, a thoroughgoing “Romantic” and comparative critic of
the modern type, while he would, of course, scout the first
party, would be loath to adopt either the method or the exact
conclusions of the second. “Let us clear our minds of cant,”
he would say. “These things are not ‘faults’ at all.  They do
not leave the court pardoned on consideration of the previous or
subsequent good behaviour of the culprit, but simply because
there is no stain on his or their character. There is no need to
plead extenuating circumstances: we stand for acquittal <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>sans
phrase</i></span>. These things might be faults elsewhere, in other
poems: they are not so here. They are the absolutely right
things in the right place, producing the right effect, driven
home by the right power to the right mark. Shakespeare
and Milton <em>have</em> faults—the somewhat excessive tendency of
the first to play on words out of season as well as in, and the
deplorable propensity of the second to joke when joking was
absolutely impossible to him. But these are not of the character
of the Longinian or Quintilianian ‘fault’ at all. They
do not endear the poets; they make them less good; we wish
they <em>were</em> faultless in this sense. Your ‘faultlessness’ simply
means that the man has that most hopeless of all faults—mediocrity:
and your ‘fault’ is simply derived from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>existence in your mind of a more or less complicated set of
rules which have no real existence. Nay,” he might proceed,
“the extremest classical men are sounder in a way than you
are. They are right in thinking that a fault <em>is</em> a fault, and
can never be ‘redeemed,’ much less purged, by a beauty. They
are only wrong in not knowing what beauties or what faults
really are.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, I do not say whether the criticism of antiquity
was right or wrong in not taking this view. But I think
there is absolutely no evidence that it was ever taken at
this time.</p>

<p class='c001'>In some other agreements and differences we find ourselves
more at home. The everlasting questions of archaic or modern
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ornate or plain style.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
language, of conceited or direct thought, of ornate or
plain style, occupied the critics of the end of the first
and the beginning of the second century, just as they have
occupied those of more recent pasts, are occupying those of the
present, and will occupy those of the future. As has been indicated
in detail, there was not here quite the critical unanimity
which some periods have shown on these and similar questions.
Among the general there was something like an agreement;
it seems undeniable that the popular taste of Roman audiences
at recitations ran towards elaborate and slightly archaic phraseology,
to Greek literary subjects, and (both in verse-epics and
tragedies and in prose declamations) to topsy-turvy conceit.
This was evidently frequent in verse, though time has carried
away most traces of it; and in prose it is not entirely alien from
the magnificent phrase-making of Tacitus, it shows itself amply
in the rhetoric of Seneca the son, as in the earlier rhetorical
examples of Seneca the father, is almost openly defended by
Pliny, and seems to receive a certain amount of “colour” (as
the rhetoricians themselves would have said) even from some
passages of Quintilian. It is very noteworthy that all these
prose-writers incline more or less to the artificial side, while
the verse-satirists argue and sally for terseness, elegance, concinnity.
And the cause may not improbably be sought in those
very declamations of which mention has been so often made.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>We have no enormous stock of them, which is not to be
regretted; but in the surviving examples we have material
which is welcome in its way, and which amply proves what has
been said.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c008'><sup>[376]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In passing, say, from Cicero, the chief prose Latin critic of præ-Augustan
times, to Quintilian, the chief of post-Augustan, and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Institutes.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
indeed of Latin critics of all dates, we come to a
man of much less genius no doubt, and, in particular,
of far less creative literary power, but still to one who, for our
special purpose, has some very considerable advantages. It is
not merely that the Spanish-Roman is a professional critic, as
well as a rhetorician—that he is as much <em>the</em> professional critic
of Latin as Dionysius of Halicarnassus (whom he much resembles,
and to whom, as has been said, he possibly owes not
a little) is of Greek. He has over the greater writer (whom he
admires so generously) the further advantage of complete
freedom from that touch of dilettantism (one is sometimes
almost tempted to use a harsher word and call it quackery)
which besets Cicero whenever he is not actually pleading or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>debating, and which is not invariably lost even then. Further,
Quintilian is the only critic of antiquity (for even Longinus, as
we saw, merely glances at the subject) who seriously takes the
two languages, seriously compares them, and, by the help of
the comparison, acquires a view-point over literature as such—not
merely as Greek or Latin literature—which was shut to all
his predecessors and most of his followers. If the <cite>Rhetoric</cite> and
the <cite>Poetics</cite> of Aristotle form the great book of critical method
for ancient times, if the Περὶ Ὕψους is the great book of their
critical inspiration; the <cite>Institutes of Oratory</cite> contain the fullest,
the most intelligent, the most satisfactory applications of criticism
to literature, as it presented itself to an intelligent and
thoroughly educated person, whose eyes were sharpened by long
expert use, at the end of the first century, when, except for a
few belated authors, mostly of curiosities, the list of the great
writers of antiquity was all but closed. The book<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c008'><sup>[377]</sup></a> is extremely
well written; it is, with a few <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cruces</i></span>, remarkably clear, and its
range and thoroughness leave practically nothing to desire.</p>

<p class='c001'>This wide range of it (which, according to different, but, in
each case, defensible interpretations of its title, busies itself
with the whole education of an orator, or with the whole theory
and practice of oratory) naturally makes it include much which
does not fall strictly within our subject. But nearly the whole
of three books, the eighth, ninth, and tenth, and a large and
important section of the twelfth, are devoted directly to that
subject; while there are references to it almost throughout. We
shall therefore, as we did in the case of Aristotle and Longinus,
give a kind of running abstract of the whole, dwelling very
briefly on the irrelevant, somewhat more fully on the partly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>relevant, fully on the rest, and returning to the consideration of
special points later.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a sort of Advertisement, to and for the use of his publisher
Trypho, and in a prefatory dedication to his friend Marcellus
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Preface.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Victorius, Quintilian gives some information
about the origin and object of the work. From this
we learn, among other things, that part-cause at least of its
actual appearance was the fact, not unknown in more modern
times, of unauthorised publication of his lectures by note-taking
pupils.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first book is devoted to the subject of the education of
boys from the earliest age, a subject on which Quintilian speaks
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Book I. Elementary Education</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
with much knowledge and good sense, as well as
kindliness. But from this he soon passes to Grammar,
and his importance for us begins. For his
treatment of the subject is quite in the larger and humaner
sense, insisting from the first on critical reading, though he
seems, as indeed we should expect, to regard the “desperate
hook” of the extremer kind of verbal critic with little favour.
It is noteworthy that he alleges music to be necessary, because
the grammarian has to speak of metre and rhythm. And passing
rapidly from considerations of orthography, right pronunciation,
and audience, he arrives at the all-important subject of
“correctness,” and of its attainment, negatively by the avoidance
of barbarisms and solecisms, positively by the selection of
the best words in the best arrangement. Observations of special
importance in this context may be cited: That the word in
itself (<i>i.e.</i>, out of connection) has no merit except its inherent
euphony; that (a most pregnant remark) it is often difficult to
distinguish Faults from Figures of speech; and some exceedingly
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>and Grammar.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
interesting, but also more than ordinarily
difficult, remarks on tone and accent-variation. In
all these grammatical notes, which are pretty full and numerous,
and often very curious—showing that, as he himself says
pleasantly, though he is not writing a treatise on Grammar, yet
as it lay in his way he did not like not to be polite to it—there is
a pervading quality of not at all Philistine common-sense which
shows the best side of the Roman temperament. Although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Quintilian acknowledges the convenience of Greek for terminology,
and makes fairly free use of the terms, it is quite
evident that he has (long before he formulates it later) a profound
and very wholesome distrust of the Greek rhetorical
practice of splitting a thing up, naming the splinters, and then
passing on, as if a real, solid, and final examination had been
attained. And the same quality appears eminently in the
summing up of his discourse on words, “Custom in speaking I
shall call the agreement of the educated, as custom in living is
the agreement of the good.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Remarks on orthography follow, and some on reading,
valuable, though not so valuable, as those on the same
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Books II.-VII. only relevant now and then.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
subject which come later. And then he passes to
certain of the <i>progymnasmata</i> of the Greek rhetoricians,
fables, uses, sentences, and “ethologies,”
which, though they have puzzled some, are clearly
the same as the <i>ethop&oelig;iæ</i> of Hermogenes and his fellows.<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c008'><sup>[378]</sup></a> All
these are, in fact, exercises in composition. The rest of the
book is occupied with the discussion of other subjects of the
school curriculum, subsidiary to rhetoric. The second book
continues the subject of Composition, but with more special
reference to Oratory proper—a tendency which naturally increases;
and for some five or six books the technicalities of the
rhetoric-school and the courts have the better of literature.
There are, however, two exceptions, which require notice—the
first a remarkable passage<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c008'><sup>[379]</sup></a> on reading or lecturing on authors.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But”—he has just ruled out the explanation of the mere
meaning of uncommon words as below the duties of a Professor
of Rhetoric—"to point out the merits, and if it so happen, the
faults, is the properest of all things for the profession and for
the promise by which he holds himself out as a master of
eloquence...." (He should make the students read in turn,
and then), "after setting forth the case on which the oration was
composed (for thus it will be more clearly understood), he should
leave nothing unnoticed which may be noteworthy in the invention
or the elocution, pointing out the manner of conciliating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>the jury in the proem, the clearness, conciseness, persuasive
force of the narration, the occasional design and hidden artifice
(for that alone is true art here, which can only be understood
by an artist), what foresight there is in division, what subtle
and thronging<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c008'><sup>[380]</sup></a> argumentation, the strength of the inspiration,
the attraction of the winning passages, the roughness<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c008'><sup>[381]</sup></a> of the
objurgation, and the humour of the jokes; how, finally, the man
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>How to lecture on an author.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
shows mastery of feeling, makes his way into the very
heart, and adjusts the minds of the jury to his own
contention. Then, as for style, we must point out
what words are proper, ornate, sublime, where the amplification
is to be praised, what excellence there is in the contrary direction,<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c008'><sup>[382]</sup></a>
what is ingeniously transferred; what the figurativeness
of the words is, how smooth and squared, yet manly, the composition."
And then he proceeds to recommend the occasional
selection of passages which are not to be praised—the exhibition,
in short, of a rhetorical helotry.</p>

<p class='c001'>No reader, I hope, will need to have it pointed out to him, at
any great length, how exactly this corresponds to the practice of
the critical lecturer or reviewer, as it ought to be, in regard to
all kinds of literature, and not oratory merely. Such a lecturer,
or such a reviewer, can do no better than grave these words of
Quintilian on his mind, and follow their directions as best he
can, whensoever an author is to be expounded on the platform
or reviewed in the column. It scarcely requires more than the
easiest and most obvious substitutions and amplifications to
make the passage a manual in miniature of all criticism, be it
of prose or poetry.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other passage is the very curious and interesting section
in the third chapter of the Sixth book, on Wit.<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c008'><sup>[383]</sup></a> As is well
known, this is one of the points on which ancient (especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Latin) and modern taste are most out of harmony. Except
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Wit.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Aristophanes at one end, with his alternations of
outrageous farce and keen poetry, and Lucian at the
other, with the innocent-seeming flow of his white-hot irony,
there are perhaps not even any Greek authors whose command
of our risibility is absolutely sure; and the average Greek
joke, as reported by the anecdote-mongers, is to us but a vapid
thing. In Latin it is even worse. Plautus pretty generally,
but in a limited way; Catullus, when he exchanges passion for
humour; sometimes Horace, for a pleasant Augustan “wit of
the town”; Martial for a too often naughty <em>persiflage</em>,—these
we have little doubt about. But Terence, even if we shut our
eyes to his borrowed capital, is but comedy-and-water; Cicero
jokes without indeed much difficulty on his part, but with
surprisingly little effect on ours; and the <em>average</em> Latin jest
is far worse than the average Greek. Of course this is all
natural enough; the jest always, save in certain transcendences,
lies more in the ear of the hearer than the charm or
quality of any other kind of literature. But it is all the
more interesting and valuable to have a set discussion on the
comic by a man of immense reading, excellent taste, and great
acuteness. Besides, Quintilian’s Spanish blood or birth may
very likely have given him a somewhat wider and more
flexible appreciation of humour than the “firm Roman” wit
itself allowed, or at least encouraged.</p>

<p class='c001'>After mentioning, as a generally accepted thing, the deficiency
of the comic element in Demosthenes, and the superabundant
quantity and inferior quality of it in Cicero (it must be remembered
that Quintilian had the Tullian <cite>Three Books of Jests</cite>,
which time has mercifully hidden from us), he passes to the
general question, and accepts the almost universal classical
opinion that laughter has always something low about it.<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c008'><sup>[384]</sup></a>
In this, we know, Plato and Aristotle both agreed; it was
a sort of postulate of all Greek philosophy, and though almost
certainly false, was excused, partly by the extreme licence of
the Comic Muse in ancient times, and partly by the rarity
of humour in the best sense, and the almost non-existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>of Romantic Comedy. He observes, however, acutely enough,
on the insufficiency of the general explanations of the origin
of laughter (an insufficiency which has certainly not been
filled up to the present day), and shows that urbane shrewdness,
which is one of his best points, by questioning whether
deliberate cultivation of jesting as an art is an altogether
satisfactory thing. But it is in his subsequent remarks on
the kind of jesting admissible in oratory (we might here at
least substitute, with hardly any wrong, “in literature”) that
his chief merit lies. On the dangerous business of verbal
distinction between <i>venustum</i>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>salsum</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>facetum</i></span> he is luminous
and useful; while his remarks, in two different places, on
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>urbanitas</i></span> are not far from a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>locus classicus</i></span>, and those<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c008'><sup>[385]</sup></a> on the
special treatise of Domitius Marsus on that topic have the
best qualities of a review—that is to say, of the kind of review
that one sees too seldom.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not, however, till the eighth book is reached (for the
seventh, except in some remarks on arrangement, is almost
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Book VIII.: Style.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
purely legal) that we find Quintilian, for a considerable
time, at close quarters with our special subject.
After summarising with remarkable clearness (so that there is
nowhere any better conspectus, in little, of the matter) the
earlier and technically rhetorical part of the <cite>Institutes</cite>, he comes
to the third part, which he calls “elocution.”<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c008'><sup>[386]</sup></a> This is no
other than the <i>lexis</i>, which Aristotle treats not indeed perfunctorily
(it was not in Aristotle to be guilty of that crime),
but with a sort of apologetic impatience, as one turning
back to the Court of the Gentiles after visiting the Holy of
Holies. The point of view, with some four hundred years of
great work, not merely in oratory, but in general literature,
behind the critic, and with the new requirement of comparison
between Greek and Latin brought in, has changed remarkably.
Instead of a popular and slightly vulgar appendix, it is (Quintilian
tells us that all orators agreed with him) the most difficult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>part of the subject. At the same time, he has not attained to
the almost perfect <i>parrhesia</i> of Longinus; he dares not tell us
(though we can see that he was sometimes half minded to do
so) that “beautiful words are the light of thought.” He has
the stereotyped caution—very wholesome in its way—to those
who neglect things and attend to words. But he will not
allow words to be neglected in their turn, and as a matter
of fact perhaps the greater, certainly the most interesting and
original, part of the five books which follow is occupied with
what, disguise itself as it may under the term of “elocution,”
is really “style.” Not, be it added, the mere fritter and foppery
which sometimes receives that name, but literary manner and
art in the great and wide sense—the proper subject, that is to
say, of literary criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>After this proem, Quintilian begins regularly on the subject—φράσις
in Greek, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>elocutio</i></span> in Latin—referring to his remarks
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Perspicuity.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in the first book (<i>vide supra</i>) on the avoidance of
Barbarism and Solecism, and glancing at Livy’s
Patavinity, and at the alleged over-Atticism of Theophrastus.
He has, however, a good deal more to say on the actual
lexicon; and in the course of it sharply perstringes that sort
of affected periphrasis which the eighteenth century (though
it thought it knew its Quintilian) so dearly loved. “The
Iberian shrub” for “broom,” the “fishes solidified by brine”
which he laughs at, are Thomson in his worst mood, Armstrong,
Mason, even Wordsworth at times, to the very life, and Delille
to more than the life—of which there is not much in that
famous Abbé. The necessity of making the epithet fit the
noun is excellently inculcated; the use of archaic technical
terms not excessively denounced. But I grieve that Quintilian
joins the herd in condemning Parenthesis, a heavenly maid
whom there have been many and great ones, from Herodotus
to De Quincey, to love, but whom few have dared to praise as
she deserves. It is true that she speaks chiefly to the sapient;
and the insipient accordingly do not love her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Passing from perspicuity to “elegance,” as our own eighteenth-century
rhetoricians would have said, Quintilian is equally
admirable; but, as before, a certain amount of “hedging” is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>perceptible in him. True beauty, he thinks, is never separable
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Elegance.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
from utility. It is a noble sentiment, and to a very
large extent a true one; but it may be questioned
whether the greatest part of its truth is not esoteric—whether
it does not arise from the suppressed rider, “because true
beauty, in merely being beautiful, <em>is</em> of the highest utility.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He himself, however, perhaps did not care to penetrate so
far with his analysis; at any rate he does not, and so he rather
beats about the bush. Grace of style will captivate; all the
great men, Aristotle no less than Cicero, say that we ought to
excite admiration. Only we must be “manly, sir, manly”; our
embellishment must not be effeminate—it must be in good
taste. The three kinds of oratory, too, will admit of different degrees—even
different kinds of embellishment. Epideictic almost
demands ostentation of ornament; debating sometimes permits
it; it must be far more cautiously used in forensic speech.
Even words must be most cautiously chosen—harshness, a touch
of the ludicrous, and other effects, unless they are deliberately
invited, must be carefully shunned. The archaic (from this
point of view there is no real contradiction with the former, <i>v.
supra</i>) will add picturesqueness, but we must walk warily with
it, we must not say <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>antigerio</i></span> for <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>valde</i></span>. Here, perhaps, one
may presume to differ with Quintilian, who extends his condemnation
to the beautiful word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ærumna</i></span>. He may have been led
to dislike it by that sensitiveness of his ear to the grunt of
the “um,” which we shall notice later, but which ought here
to have been appeased by the musical syllables on either side.</p>

<p class='c001'>Proceeding from individual words to connected speech, he
has some capital cautions on unlucky conjunctions of words,
suggesting double meaning—with, however, the still wiser
reflection that if you are always looking out for this, you had
better hold your tongue altogether. A handful of the rhetorical
tickets—<i>tapeinosis</i>,<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c008'><sup>[387]</sup></a> <i>meiosis</i>,<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c008'><sup>[388]</sup></a> Hom&oelig;ology, Macrology, pleonasm,
<i>cacozelon</i>,<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c008'><sup>[389]</sup></a> and so forth—is taken up, and they are shaken out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>and shown to be at least susceptible of useful application,
while in the passages that follow (the conclusion of the third
chapter) some celebrated <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>loci</i></span><a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c008'><sup>[390]</sup></a> are severally examined, with an
admirable combination of verbal acuteness and general grasp.
The shorter fourth chapter deals in the same way with the
favourite figure of Amplification and its opposite Diminution, as
exemplified in chosen illustrations. Then he turns (and we
must remember that the turn is not arbitrary nor desultory,
but follows the divisions of the older Rhetoric) to those sentences
or <i>gnomæ</i>, as the Greeks termed them, which had such
an effect on ancient audiences, and which, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mutatis mutandis</i></span>, are
not without effect on modern readers. We have seen very
recently how the mere trick of what may be called “topsy-turvyfying”
accepted maxims has, not once or twice, but again
and again, managed to secure an audience.</p>

<p class='c001'>This section ends with a passage of such weight and importance
as general criticism that we must give it nearly <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in
extenso</i></span>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“But there will be no end to it if I follow out individual
forms of corrupt taste. It is better to turn to what is more
necessary. There are two opposite opinions on this subject;
some hardly pay attention to anything but ‘sentences’—some
utterly condemn them; and with neither do I entirely agree.
If sentences are too crowded they get in each other’s way, just
as, with all crops and trees, nothing can grow to a proper size if
it lacks room. Nor does anything stand out in a picture where
there is no shading; so that artists, when they deal with many
things in one canvas, leave spaces between them lest shade and
object fall together. Moreover, this same profusion cuts the
style too short; for each sentence stands by itself,<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c008'><sup>[391]</sup></a> and there is,
as it were, a fresh beginning after it. Whence the composition
becomes too disjointed, consisting not of integral members, but
of separate scraps, inasmuch as these things, each rounded and
cut off from the rest, refuse conjunction.<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c008'><sup>[392]</sup></a> Besides, the colour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>the speech becomes, as it were, spotty with blotches, bright
indeed, but too many and too different. For though a selvage
and fringes of purple, in their proper place, light up the gown,
a garment speckled with patches of colour is certainly unbecoming.
Wherefore, though these sentences may seem to
flash and to strike in some sense, yet they are lights which may
be likened, not to flame but to sparks amid smoke: they are
not even seen when the whole speech is luminous, as the stars
themselves cease to be visible in sunshine. And, rising only
with fitful and feeble effort, they are but unequal, and, as it
were, broken, so as to attain neither the admiration due to
things eminent nor the grace of a close uniformity” (VIII. v.
25-29).</p>

<p class='c001'>The end of the Eighth book, and the beginning of the Ninth,
deal with the subject—the all too famous and long-studied
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Books VIII., IX.: Tropes and  Figures.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
subject—of Tropes and Figures, which Quintilian
distinguishes from one another a little artificially,
and with a kind of confession that the distinction is
sometimes correspondent to no real difference. It is
not till rather late in his handling (IX. i. 22) that he makes that
scornful reference to the Greek abundance in this kind which
has been itself more than once referred to here. He is bound to
say that figures are by no means so numerous as some would
make them out. Nor have the names, which the Greeks can
botch up at any occasion, the least influence with him.<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c008'><sup>[393]</sup></a> And
he is particularly earnest in condemning the practice of allotting
a Figure to every affection of the mind—a practice certainly
absurd enough, though no very unnatural consequence of the
constitution of “figures” as real things.<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c008'><sup>[394]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>He himself, however, is by no means stingy of accepted Tropes
and Figures, though he treats them, with his usual common-sense,
as names, not things. The first place, in his discussion
and enumeration of the matter, is occupied as usual by Metaphor,
a mode of speech so prevailing in both senses that, here at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>least, no objection can be made to its constitution into a quasi-entity.
He calls it “the most frequent and by far the most
beautiful,” points out, of course, that it is only Simile in another
and shorter form, and illustrates its kinds by examples in the
best critical style. He specifies these kinds; but once more
<em>not</em> to distinguish for the mere sake o£ distinguishing. In fact,
here as elsewhere, we may notice that Quintilian, half unconsciously,
stops short at the points where Rhetoric parts company
with literary criticism, and becomes mere pseudo-science.
From Metaphor he goes, treating them in the same way, as with
all the tropes and figures that he mentions, to Synecdoche, Metonymy,
Hypallage; and has some good remarks on the fine but
real distinctions between the indulgences in these flights and
sleights which are, and those which are not, permissible to the
orator, whom he practically identifies with the prose-writer by
contrasting him with the poet. Antonomasia, which is of the
same family, follows, and then a rather disappointing treatment
of Onomatop&oelig;ia. One sees here the Roman, and the late
Roman, but also the yearner after better things, in the observation
that “this, which the Greeks thought one of the greatest
excellences, is scarcely allowed <em>us</em>.” “We do not dare to form a
new word,” he says, and tells us that even the formation of such
words, on strict analogy of others, was scarcely ventured on,<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c008'><sup>[395]</sup></a> and
that the inability to compound, which has so notoriously manifested
itself later in her greatest daughter, was beginning to
appear in Latin. In short, Latin had reached a stationary state—the
state of the nation <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>qui cesse de prendre</i></span>, if not quite of that
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>qui commence à rendre</i></span>. It had to become the picturesque and
delightful, if perhaps too much crossed and blended, Low Latin
of the Dark and Middle Ages before it could recover itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Catachresis, Metalepsis, the ornamental and “perpetual”
epithet follow; and then we come to the fruitful subject of
Allegory.</p>

<p class='c001'>Quintilian is perhaps not exactly the writer from whom we
should expect a thoroughly satisfactory treatment of this great
subject—a subject which, far more than metaphor, escapes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>state of a mere rhetorical ticket, and challenges that of a real
literary quality or kind. Although it is unjust to represent
him as merely conversant in details and afraid to rise, a certain
timidity serves as the Nemesis of his common-sense. Besides,
his materials were not favourable: the great allegorical style of
Plato had long passed, not to be revived; the magnificent exuberance
of mediæval fancy in this kind was far in the future;
the exercises which Quintilian had before him were either mere
phrases in the poets, tedious didactic things in the philosophers,
or such easy examples as Horace’s “O navis,” which he quotes.
We have therefore no such handling of the matter as we might
have had from Longinus. And when we are told that the most
ornamental kind of writing by far is that in which the three
figures—simile, metaphor, and allegory—are mixed, we seem to
see the worst side of Rhetoric as we seldom do in Quintilian.
Once more there arises the picture of a dismal sort of library-laboratory,
with bottles and drawers full of ready cold-drawn
or ready short-cut figures—of the literary dispenser, with his
apron on and his balance adjusted, taking a handful of this, two
ounces of that, three drachms of the other, and compounding a
draught or a pill to be exhibited in the forum, or the lecture-room,
or the courts of justice, as the case may be. But he
recovers himself soon, if only by the dry fashion in which he
observes that, if anybody does not know it, the Greeks call
certain kinds of allegory sarcasm, asteism, antiphrasis, and
par&oelig;mia, to which it may be well to add mycterism,<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c008'><sup>[396]</sup></a> a kind of
derision which is dissembled, but not altogether concealed—as
very neatly by M. Fabius Quintilianus in the passage before us.</p>

<p class='c001'>Periphrasis, Hyperbaton, Hyperbole close the chapter, and
the book, and Quintilian shines on the latter, while at the end
he refers to his lost dialogue <cite>On the Causes of the Corruption of
Eloquence</cite>, one of the things of its kind which we must regret
most.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Ninth book opens with the distinction between Trope and
Figure,<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c008'><sup>[397]</sup></a> and with some general remarks on the latter word which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>illustrate rather amusingly the Delilah-effect of it on those who
use it. We should not have been sorry to have had that
treatise of Apollodorus which Quintilian seems only to have
known through Cæcilius (the writer on the Sublime), and in
which the author by no means frivolously argued that, in the
common sense of Figure, everything is a figure, and the
enumeration of figures is impossible and useless. We should
have thanked Time for sparing that other of the Homeromastix,
in which Zoilus, with better sense apparently than when he
talked of matters too high for him, limited the word Figure to a
phrase, in which the apparent or first meaning is different from
the second or real. And Quintilian himself, when he comes
to the distinction between Figures of Thought and Figures of
Speech, illustrates (whether purposely or not it is difficult to
say) the purely childish side of the matter, by remarking that
in one of the Verrines, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jamjam</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liberum</i></span> are figures of speech.
For, as the commentators have gravely worked it out, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jamjam</i></span>
is a Palillogia or repetition, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liberum</i></span>, contracted from
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>libeirum</i></span>, is an instance of Syncope. Verily, one exclaims,
there is much to be said for Apollodorus! And when he
further observes that the greatest power of Figures is to render
oratory attractive, one feels inclined to say, “The figure is
nothing, and the power of making figures is less; but there <em>are</em>
attractive qualities in oratory, and you may ticket them as
figures, within moderation, as you like.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But it would be a delusion to suppose Quintilian himself
deluded. Immediately after the passage just quoted comes his
Declaration of Independence in regard to the Greek nomenclature,
a fresh observation in the same key “to exhibit anger or
grief, or any other passion in literature, is not of itself to be
figurative, though one may use figures in the expression,” and—after
two quotations from Cicero, in which crowds of figures
are introduced and named—a distinct, though gentle, hint that,
much as he admires Cicero, he thinks him too prodigal here.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two long chapters, the second and third of the Ninth Book,
contain Quintilian’s own survey of figures as distinguished from
tropes, and as divided into figures of thought and speech respectively.
He opens the first division with Interrogation—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>rhetorical interrogation, of course; he goes on to Anticipation
(<i>prolepsis</i> in a sense different from the usual one); Feigned
Doubt, Communication,<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c008'><sup>[398]</sup></a> Feigned Passion, Prosopopeia, Apostrophe,
Hypotyposis, and then regains more open and higher
ground for a time with the great figure of Irony, of which, however,
he makes relatively as little as of Allegory. Aposiopesis,
Ethop&oelig;ia, and Emphasis follow, with something to which he
gives no definite name, but which approaches Parable. After
this he becomes rather technically forensic, and winds up with
a shower of names of the verbal hair-splitting kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Verbal figures—"Figures of Speech" proper—begin, after some
general remarks, by examples which seem to bring us back to
the old conclusion that “everything is a figure,” and which are
sometimes barely intelligible, as where <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Sthenelus sciens pugnæ</i></span>,
which seems to us a most ordinary expression, is said to show
two figures combined.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c008'><sup>[399]</sup></a> The Figures themselves, where named
distinctly, range from such familiar things as Parenthesis and
Climax to more technical ones in Epanodos<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c008'><sup>[400]</sup></a> and Paradiastole.<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c008'><sup>[401]</sup></a>
Others, familiar and less familiar, follow, but at last Quintilian
grows impatient, and after plumply denying that Paromologia<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c008'><sup>[402]</sup></a>
and Parasiopesis<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c008'><sup>[403]</sup></a> are figures at all, declares roundly that he shall
pay no attention to authors who have made no end of mere
term-seeking, and have classed arguments among Figures. And
he winds up the whole with a weighty caution against abusing
even those Figures which he has admitted. Of such abuse,
almost all times, whether they have been devoted to nominated
Figures or not, leave more than sufficient record: but it can
never have been more tempting or more frequent than when the
process of peppering style with the contents of a certified
chemist’s shop of Figures was almost prescribed by the orthodox
curriculum of literary education.</p>

<p class='c001'>The connection, however, with strictly literary criticism becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>closer still in the following (fourth) chapter of the Ninth
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Composition.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Book, which, together with the surveys of literature
in the Tenth and Twelfth, is <em>the</em> “place” of Quintilian
for our subject. For it deals directly with Composition, in the
higher sense of attention to style, and before very long we see
that what is immediately uppermost in Quintilian’s mind at the
moment is the order of the words, and the consequent rhythmical
effect. He spends, after a fashion pardonable to the
professional declaimer and teacher of rhetoric, some time on
general remarks, rebutting the silly talk, common then as now,
about the superiority of natural to artificial eloquence, the frippery
of style, and the like. And then he mounts the battle-horse
of all true critics, the argument from alteration of arrangement
of words, adding, truly enough, that the more
beautiful the sentence which is thus distorted, the worse will
the distortion seem. He turns to an interesting and quite
relevant historical digression on the lateness of deliberate style,
and on its differences, narrowing these for the present to two,
“loose” and “firm,” by which it would appear that he does not
mean the usual contrast of “loose” and “periodic,” but merely
that between irregular conversational style and set speech.
Then, noting the technical divisions of phrases, clauses, and
sentences, he considers the order of words, and (being a Latin)
of course urges the conclusion of the sentence with a verb,
where possible, and perstringes certain sentences of Mæcenas,
a notedly “precious” writer, in which we can only dimly perceive
the offence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Remarks on emphasis, hiatus, cacophonous conjunction of
consonants, jingle, plethora of monosyllables, and the like,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Prose rhythm.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
follow, and then the great and difficult subject of
rhythm is tackled directly. Distinguishing it from
metre, correctly if not quite sufficiently, by the necessity that
the latter should show a certain order, he proceeds to deal with
the proper rhythm of prose in the most difficult, but not least
important, passage of his book, rightly insisting in sum on the
presence of <em>numbers</em>, which are not to be monotonous. Some of
his minor directions are, indeed, dark to us, especially his objection,
not merely in prose, but even in verse, to polysyllables at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>the end. And though we are in full light again when he
denounces complete verses in prose (the chief formal fault of
Mr Ruskin), he, here also, goes too far for us. The most delicate
English ear would not object to the equivalent of Sallust’s
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Falso queritur de natura sua,”</span><a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c008'><sup>[404]</sup></a> to the commencement of a
hexameter in the <cite>Timæus</cite>,<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c008'><sup>[405]</sup></a> or to the muffled Galliambic of
Thucydides.<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c008'><sup>[406]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But this in the last case is, perhaps, due to the fact that the
pæon is hardly an English poetic foot at all, and in the first to
the fact that we have nothing corresponding to the strangely
broken rhythm of the Latin comic senarius and tetrameter. It
is, however, in dealing with the feet of prose that Quintilian,
like Aristotle, gets most out of our depth, and for the same
reason, that we really do not know enough—if we know anything—about
the pronunciation, or intonation, of Greek and
Latin. Yet the general drift, if here and there we do not quite
“feel our feet,” is unmistakable and unmistakably correct, and
the whole is an excellent sample of a kind of criticism most
necessary, much neglected in modern times till very recently,
and entirely independent of any mere rhetorical technicality.
And it is followed—at section 116 onward—by some general
remarks of capital importance, laying down among other things
that the chief touchstone of composition is the ear, and admitting
that in many cases, both of selection of single words
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ordonnance</i></span> of phrases, it is impossible to render an exact
reason why one thing is right and another wrong. It is so:
and there’s an end on’t! In the peroration of the Book, first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>the orator receives some special, and then (at 138 onward) the
author, in verse as well as in prose, some general, cautions and
admonitions as to musical effect.</p>

<p class='c001'>But all this, good as it is, could be easily spared, if the choice
lay between it and the Tenth book. For here, and here only, do
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Book X.: Survey of Classical Literature.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
we get, from an eminent critic of the first rank, a
critical survey of the joint literatures of Greece and
Rome, during the main classical course of both. Interesting
as this would be from any one of tolerable
ability, seeing that it is precisely what we lack—doubly interesting
as it is from a man of Quintilian’s learning, long practice
in teaching, and interest in the subject—it becomes trebly so
from certain characteristics of his which have been more than
once glanced at, and which make him an almost perfect, certainly
a typical, exponent in rational form of what may be regarded
as the standard orthodoxy—the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>textus receptus</i></span> of the
critical creed—of the ancients. Aristotle came too early to give
this opinion with full knowledge, and would, perhaps, always
have been disinclined to give it in the same way. Longinus,
we feel, is an exception of genius. But what Quintilian says
the enormous majority of cultivated Greeks and Romans (allowing
in the former case for particularist and parochial contempt
of the latter) are likely to have thought. He prefaces the survey
by an interesting, and perhaps not really equivocal, explanation
of the reasons for its insertion. I say “perhaps not
really equivocal,” because Quintilian, a very genuine person,
would not have hesitated to give it the form of an apology if he
had meant it apologetically. The orator on his probation must,
he says, study and imitate for himself all the best authors, not
merely the orators themselves, but, as no less an authority than
Theophrastus recommended, poets, and historians, and philosophers.
But this must be done with care and judgment; for
the methods of history are not the same as those of oratory,
and it is no use addressing one kind of juryman with the
pregnant terseness of Sallust, or another kind with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lactea
ubertas</i></span> of Livy, while the philosophers require the same
caution, put in a different way. And some remarks of his
on at least the more celebrated authors will be expected by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>his friends—to which friends we owe more thanks than is
always the case.</p>

<p class='c001'>He “begins with Zeus,” that is to say, Homer, and delivers a
very neat set criticism on him from that oratorical point of view
which was so common in regard to both Homer and Virgil.</p>

<p class='c001'>“For he, as,” in his own words, "the violence of rivers and
the courses of the springs take their beginning from the ocean,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Greek: Homer and other Epic poets.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
has given an example and a starting-point to all
parts of eloquence. Him none has excelled, for
great things in sublimity as for small ones in
propriety of speech. At once abundant and compressed,
agreeable and serious, wonderful now in volume, now
in terseness, is he; and not only in poetical, but also in
oratorical, virtue most eminent. For, not to say anything of
his panegyrics, his hortatives, his consolations, do not the
Ninth Book, with the embassy sent to Achilles, and the
quarrel between the generals in the First, and the sentences
expressed in the Second, set forth every device of advocacy
and debate?" &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>Others he treats more briefly. Hesiod is in the middle style
only, but easy and sententious in that. Antimachus<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c008'><sup>[407]</sup></a> (one of
our losses) is second to Homer, has force, energy, originality,
but is deficient in attractiveness and in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ordonnance</i></span>. Panyasis
(another) excels Hesiod in subject and Antimachus in treatment.
Apollonius has an evenly sustained mediocrity. Aratus
is “equal to the work to which he thought himself equal”—an
ingeniously double-edged compliment. Theocritus (one must
quote the whole of this, and waive the discussion of it) “is
admirable in his peculiar style, but his rustic and pastoral
muse shrinks not only from appearing in the forum, but even
from approaching the city.” And then Pisander, Nicander,
Euphorion, Tyrtæus, Callimachus, Philetas are slid over rapidly,
while, though Aristarchus had sanctioned three <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>iambographi</i></span>,
Simonides and Hipponax are passed in silence, Archilochus only
receiving very high praise for vigour and all similar qualities.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>So, too, of the nine canonical lyrists, Bacchylides, Ibycus,
Anacreon, Alcman, and even Sappho, are overlooked. Pindar
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Lyrists.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
has a brilliant testimonial, to which, however, the
authority of Horace seems to be thought necessary
as an indorsement. Stesichorus is “equal to a great subject,
strong, dignified, but exuberant.” Alcæus is magnificent, but
descends to sportive and amorous subjects (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ecce idola scholæ!</i></span>);
and Simonides, though of no very lofty genius, is correct and
pleasing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Old Comedy, with the usual three selected, but not
characterised separately, is better adapted for the orator’s use
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Drama.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
than anything save Homer: it is the cream of Attic;
it is graceful, elegant (and one may wonder for a
moment, but it is a useful warning as to the connotation of the
word), “sublime.” The judgment of the three tragedians is
scarcely worthy of Quintilian. He speaks of Æschylus very
much as a Frenchman, not in the times of utter ignorance,
used to speak of Shakespeare. He is half silent, half enigmatic,
on Sophocles; but he gives Euripides obviously heartfelt
praise, and thinks him the most serviceable study of
all for the orator. To which observations Aristophanes would
pretty certainly have retorted (clothing the retort in language
perhaps sadly lacking in decorum) that it was not very
wonderful that the sophist should be useful to the rhetorician.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very high, too, is the praise of Menander. Indeed, as we
have seen before, Menander held a much higher position with
the ancients than, if we had more than fragments of him, he
would, from those fragments, be likely to hold with the moderns.
He is praised (almost in the very words) for his “criticism of
life,”<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c008'><sup>[408]</sup></a> and a tradition is mentioned that he was an orator as well
as a poet. But whether this be the case or not, passages in his
plays are cited as possessing all the charms of eloquence, and
he is especially extolled for that presentation of character—<i>ethop&oelig;ia</i>—which
the ancients exacted from the orator even more
than from the poet. Philemon is the other late comic mentioned,
and though the taste of the age that preferred him
is denounced as bad, he is admitted as a fair second.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Herodotus and Thucydides are of course put in front of the
historians, and are contrasted fairly, though not with a great
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Historians.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
deal of penetration. Theopompus, Philistus, Ephorus,
Clitarchus, and Timagenes are slightly mentioned:
but Xenophon, somewhat to our surprise, is put off to the
philosophers. Yet this is of itself a useful <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>datum</i></span> for our
inquiry, when we think how low <em>we</em> should put Xenophon’s
contributions to philosophy (as distinguished of course from
philosophical biography), how much higher even the rather
dry annals of the <cite>Hellenics</cite>, how much higher still the agreeable
miscellanies, and the pleasant didactic romance of the <cite>Cyropædia</cite>,
and how far highest of all, the <cite>Anabasis</cite>, with its vivid
realisation of action and scenery, and the narrative power which
gives a romantic interest to the rather undeserved escape of a
gang of mercenary filibusters.</p>

<p class='c001'>Conscious, probably, that the comparison of them must be
hackneyed, Quintilian does not dwell long on the Greek orators,
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The orators and philosophers.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
even on that half of The Ten which he selects, and
of the later speakers mentions only Demetrius Phalereus.
He is much more enthusiastic about the
philosophers, discerning “agreeableness” of style<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c008'><sup>[409]</sup></a> in Aristotle,
a judgment in which few of us who have groaned over the not
indeed obscure, but hard and juiceless, language of the <cite>Ethics</cite>
and the <cite>Organon</cite>, will quite acquiesce, while we might think
it rather kind even for that which clothes the more popular
matter of the <cite>Politics</cite>, <cite>Poetics</cite>, and <cite>Rhetoric</cite>. But it would not
be easy better to recognise the mastery of Plato, “whether in
acumen of argument, or in a certain divine and Homeric faculty
of style.” He rises far above mere prose, and seems instinct,
not with human reason, but with a sort of Delphic inspiration.
Xenophon at last receives due meed for his “unaffected delightfulness
beyond the reach of affectation,” and the “persuasive
goddess that sits on his lips.”<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c008'><sup>[410]</sup></a> Perhaps Theophrastus may
be a “little overparted” with “divine brilliance,”<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c008'><sup>[411]</sup></a> though of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>course the epithet is a mere translation of the name Aristotle
gave him.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the critic approaches his own countrymen his words
have, perhaps, an even greater interest. He begins of course
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Latin—Virgil.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
with Virgil, and, as in duty bound, ranks him next
to Homer, and nearer Homer than any one is near
himself. Yet a suspicion crosses one’s mind whether Quintilian
was exactly enthusiastic about the elegant Mantuan, for
he talks about his being “obliged to take more care,”<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c008'><sup>[412]</sup></a> about
his losing in the higher qualities, but finding compensations,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far so good. But what shall we say of this: “All others
must follow afar off. For Macer and Lucretius are indeed to
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Other epic and didactic poets.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
be read, but not for supplying phrase—that is to
say, the body of style. Each is elegant in his own
subject, but the one is tame and the other difficult.”
Now, as to Macer we know little or nothing; he seems to have
been a sort of Roman Armstrong or Darwin, who wrote about
herbs, drugs, &amp;c.<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c008'><sup>[413]</sup></a> But Lucretius—a greater master of phrase
than Landor himself, nay, a greater, perhaps, than Milton—"not
good for supplying" it, and merely “difficult”? One
wants, again, some Aristophanic interjection. Varro is damned
with faint praise as not indeed despicable (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>non spernendus
quidem</i></span>), but <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>parum locuples</i></span>. Ennius is spoken of as some of
our own critics used to speak of Chaucer—as a gigantic
and aged oak, venerable but not beautiful. Ovid is “wanton,”
and too fond of his own conceits. Valerius Flaccus is a great
loss. Others—Severus, Bassus, Rabirius, Pedo<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c008'><sup>[414]</sup></a>—names to us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>mostly, though we have fragments of at least three, are dismissed,
the two first with high praise, the two last with the
scarcely enthusiastic remark that the orator may read them, if
<em>he has time</em>. Lucan is ardent, eager, and of noble sententiousness,
but rather an orator than a poet. Domitian would have
been the greatest of poets, <em>if</em> the gods had pleased. But,
unluckily, they did not please!</p>

<p class='c001'>In elegy Tibullus is Quintilian’s choice, but he admits that
others prefer Propertius. Ovid is more luxuriant than either;
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Elegiac and miscellaneous.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Gallus harsher. Horace receives praise thrice over
as terse, pure and just in satire, bitter in iambics
(lampoons), and almost the only Roman deserving
to be read<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c008'><sup>[415]</sup></a> in lyric—where he sometimes soars. He is full of
pleasant grace, and is agreeably audacious. After this, or
rather before it, it is not surprising that Catullus is only
mentioned for “bitter” iambics. As older satirists (“Satire
is <em>ours</em>!” says Quintilian with a pleasant patriotic exaltation),
Lucilius and Varro have praise.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remarks on Tragedy we are unfortunately unable to
check; but it is interesting that Quintilian apparently thought
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Drama.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Latin better off here than in Comedy, which we
certainly should not have expected. He quotes
the traditional praise of the language of Plautus without expressing
any opinion on it, but in a fashion pretty clearly
intimating that he was unable to agree.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c008'><sup>[416]</sup></a> “The ancients extol
Cæcilius,”—another phrase which can only be pointed in one
way; and Terence, though extremely elegant in his kind,
scarcely attains to a faint image of Greek. It seems, however, as
if he would have thought better of Afranius had it not been for
that foulness of subject which, from the frequency of mention
of it in connection with the author, seems to have turned the
by no means squeamish stomach even of less moral Romans.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>He is much more patriotic in regard to History—in fact, his
patriotism rather outruns his discretion. One may have the
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>History.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
highest admiration of Sallust’s masterly sweep (“immortal
velocity” Quintilian himself calls it), of his
pregnant thought and vivid representation, yet hesitate to
match the two miniatures or Kit-cats of the <cite>Jugurtha</cite> and the
<cite>Catiline</cite> against the mighty grasp and volume, alike in whole
and in detail, of the <cite>Peloponnesian War</cite>. It must, however, be
remembered that Sallust wrote a larger <cite>History</cite> in four books,
which is lost except in fragments. Livy with Herodotus,
though Quintilian thinks the latter ought not to feel indignant
at the match, is only not so <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>impar congressus</i></span>, because there is
here no unequality in scale and range. But, once more, the
expression of opinion is a valuable one, and we must come
back to it. Of Servilius Nonianus and Aufidius Bassus we
know nothing; but the section ends with a high and most
interesting panegyric on a certain unnamed living historian,
whom we must all hope, though some would identify him
with Pliny, to be Tacitus. If <em>he</em> had been equalled with even
the greatest of the Greeks, Thucydides might have made room
for him with hardly condescending good-humour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having thus put himself in the mood of “our country right
or wrong” by this time, Quintilian is emboldened to match
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Oratory—Cicero.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Cicero against any Greek orator, though he proceeds
to explain that this is not meant to depress Demosthenes.
Thus minded, he certainly does not go to work “with
a dead hand,” as the French say, and endows his favourite not
merely with the energy of Demosthenes, but with the flow of
Plato and the sweetness of Isocrates. (One may invoke the aid
of Echo—courteous nymph—and assent at least to Isocrates.)
And then he passes to other Latin orators, praising Pollio for
pains, and Messala for an aristocratic elegance. Cæsar (it is
noticeable that he says nothing of the <cite>Commentaries</cite>) has qualities
in his speeches which might have made him a rival to
Cicero, especially the elegance of his diction. Cælius for wit;
Calvus for severe correctness; others for other things, receive
homage.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Latin philosophy he again, with some rashness, advances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Cicero as a rival to Plato, and ends with a curious and interesting
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Philosophy—Cicero and Seneca.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
passage on Seneca, whom he had been supposed
to condemn and even hate, whose vitiated taste he
still reprehends, but to whose real merits he now
makes handsome concessions. This is quite one of Quintilian’s
best “diploma-pieces” as a literary critic, in the division of decided
but not illiberal censure, qualified by just and not grudging
allowance for merits. It is a pity that it is too long to
quote.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the rest of the book, interesting as it is and germane
to our subject, we must deal more succinctly. It first handles
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Minor counsel of the Tenth Book.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Imitation of the styles just run through, and contains
some of the best advice available anywhere
on that head. The danger of imitating one style
is especially dwelt upon, and Quintilian draws nearer to Greece
or England than to Rome, in the simple observation that he
has known Ciceronians think themselves quite accomplished
when they ended a sentence with <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>esse videatur</i></span>. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Habemus
criticum!</i></span> Another most excellent chapter is devoted to Writing—that
is to say, to “exercises in composition,” which, under
the dispensation of Rhetoric, were much in use.  We know
that Cicero wrote theses at the moment, and on the subject,
of his sorest trouble. Quintilian’s advice here again is excellent;
and if it were worse, it would be saved by the delightful
story he tells of Julius Florus, a Gaulish provincial
(for literary talent was beginning to be centrifugal), who, to
his nephew and Quintilian’s friend Julius Secundus, when he
was troubled about his style, observed, “Do you want to write
better than you can?” Nor should the subsequent observations
on rough copies be passed over. The rough copy is the
superstition of those who wish to write better than they can.
In some respects, and especially for the urbane, intimate,
un-Philistine common-sense of it, this is one of Quintilian’s
best chapters. He follows it up by a short one on Correction,
wisely observing that we may indulge in that too much; by
another on Translation, dedication-writing, and so forth; by
yet another on premeditation, and by a last on speaking extempore,
which he says (irrefutably from his oratorical point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>of view, and perhaps not much less so from the point of general
literature) is all but a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sine qua non</i></span>. In these later chapters
he is, as we may say, pursuing the art of the critic the reverse
way—that is to say, he is counselling the author how to anticipate
the critic. But it ought to be needless to add that they
are not the less important as chapters of a manual of criticism
itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Eleventh book is wholly professional, dealing with the
manner and general conduct appropriate to the orator, the
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Books XI., XII.: The styles of oratory.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
cultivation of the memory, delivery, gesture, and
so forth. It therefore yields us nothing, while the
beginning of the Twelfth, with its respectable paradox
that a good orator must be a good man,
may not look more promising, nor the subsequent demonstration
that he ought to be acquainted with the civil law, and
with examples and precedents, that he must have firmness
and presence of mind, years of discretion, and also reasonable
fees and retainers, that he must study his brief, not lay himself
out too much for mere applause, and while preparing
carefully, be ready with impromptus and extempore speech
when necessary. But when we are beginning to get a little
weary of this good-man-of-the-Stoics, called to the bar, an
abrupt turn to the style of oratory refreshes us. The sketch
of literature in the Tenth Book had been made, it is to be
remembered, from a somewhat different point of view; it
had been occupied with the authors whom an orator should
read, and the qualities which were to be discovered in them.
Here the standpoint changes, and the literary quality of
what the orator himself is to produce is the question. After
a distinctly interesting parallel from painting and sculpture,
to illustrate differences of style, Quintilian takes up these differences,
in some cases repeating the descriptions of Book X.,
in reference to Latin orators, and especially renewing his eulogy
of Cicero as excellent in every oratorical quality. This, however,
he admits, was by no means the universal opinion, either
of Cicero’s contemporaries or of succeeding critics. And he hits
a distinct blot in too much literary criticism by pointing out
that while these earlier critics usually censured the great Arpinate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>as too flowery, too Asiatic, too fond of jests, his, Quintilian’s,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“<i>Atticism.</i>”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
own contemporaries were apt to speak of him as dry
and wanting in succulence. Next he turns to the three famous
divisions of oratorical style—Attic, Asiatic, and
Rhodian: the first chastened, energetic, correct; the
second redundant and flowery; the third a mixture of the other
two. And then, with his usual unpretending shrewdness, he
proceeds to point out that although there certainly <em>is</em> an Attic
style, and this style is far the best, yet that there are many,
nay, infinite varieties and subdivisions of it—that Lysias is not
in the least like Andocides, Isocrates different from either,
Hyperides apart from all three. And so, with perfect good
sense, he objects to the limitation of the “odour of thyme,” the
Attic charm, to those who “flow as a slender stream making its
way through pebbles”—that is to say, to those who write in a
studiously correct and elegant style, with no magniloquence or
turbid rush.</p>

<p class='c001'>More interesting still, because it is the first and by far
the best thing of the kind that we have, is the passage
which follows on the oratorical—we may excusably read the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Literary quality of Greek and Latin.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
“literary”—qualities of the Latin language as compared
with the Greek. There are, it is true, phonetic
difficulties here, and probably no wise man will
pretend to understand Quintilian’s praise of the
“sweetness” of the Greek <i>phi</i>, as compared with the harsh
repulsiveness of the Latin <i>f</i> and <i>v</i>. No one but a student of
phonetics themselves (that is to say, of a science as arbitrary
as the most technical part of the Hermogenean rhetoric) can
perceive any difference between <i>phi</i> and <i>f</i>, or the repulsiveness
of the latter and of <i>v</i>, or the extra harshness of <i>fr</i> as in <i>frangit</i>.
<i>Fr</i>, to a modern English ear, gives a very harmonious sound
indeed. He incidentally, however, as far as <i>v</i> is concerned,
gives us a “light” by saying that the sound of the digamma was
preserved in <i>Servus</i> and <i>Cervus</i>, so that the Romans adopted the
Wellerian form in these words; and has a specially interesting
observation (because it applies equally to Anglo-Saxon) on the
ugliness of terminations in <i>m</i>, “like the lowing of an ox,” as
opposed to the clear ringing Greek <i>n</i>. The intonation of Latin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>he also thinks inferior to Greek, and still more the vocabulary.
But <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sursum corda</i></span>! after all:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Wherefore, if any demand from Latins the grace of Attic
speech, let him give us the same sweetness of utterance, and an
equal abundance of words. If this be denied, we must match
our meaning to the words we have, nor mix a too great subtlety
of matter with words too strong, not to say too stout, for it, lest
the combination lose either excellence. The less the mere
language helps us, the more we must reinforce ourselves by invention
of matter. Let us extract sublime and varied meanings.
Let us stir all the passions, and illuminate our addresses
with gleaming metaphor. We cannot be so graceful; let us be
more vigorous. We are conquered in subtlety; let us prevail
in weight. <em>They</em> are surer of propriety, let <em>us</em> overcome by
numbers. The genius of the Greeks, even in their lesser men,
has its own ports; let us spread more ample sail and fill it with
a mightier breeze. Nor let us always seek the deep; we must
sometimes follow the windings of the shore. <em>They</em> may slip
over any shallows; let <em>me</em> find a deeper sea in which my
bark may not sink.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A very little farther<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c008'><sup>[417]</sup></a> and we find Wordsworth’s paradox in
the Preface to the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>—that there is no natural
eloquence but in the speech of ordinary folk—anticipated,
stated, and very happily and thoroughly answered, though in
reference to prose, not verse; and after this, some interesting
further observations on <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sententiæ</i></span>—deliberate and ostentatious
sententiousnesses.</p>

<p class='c001'>Later still he returns upon himself, and adopts a fresh
threefold division into ἰσχνὸν or plain; ἁδρὸν or grand; and
ἀνθηρὸν or florid, examples of each of which, with oratorical
adaptations, he proceeds to give, perorating on plain and florid
style, in a manner not unworthy of his precepts. He concludes
with a sort of postscript on the necessity of the orator’s
withdrawing before his natural force is abated, and thus
leads, by a not ungraceful parable, to his own <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Finis</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be hoped that the above analysis, however jejune
and imperfect, of this remarkable book will at least serve as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>basis for some intelligible, if brief, remarks on its position
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Quintilian’s critical ethos.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and value in the history of literary criticism. Its
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>status</i></span> as a document of this is, like that of all other
ancient documents without exception (even the Περὶ Ὕψους
cannot rank as completely exceptional), an indirect one,
one of but partial relevance to the gospel of criticism. The Law
of Rhetoric was but a schoolmaster, teaching, like all good
schoolmasters, many things which had no absolute bearing on
the future life of its pupils. And it is all the more curious
that Quintilian should nevertheless give us so much that is of
direct importance, because he is not merely a literary critic
at intervals, but almost a literary critic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>malgré lui</i></span>. Except
in the case of Cicero, where his professional feeling comes
in, he displays no very great enthusiasm for literature. He
is never tempted, as not merely Longinus, but even Dionysius,
is, to take a particular author, book, piece, and thoroughly
analyse him and it, to grasp it, turn it lovingly inside out, hold
it up to the admiration of others, deck it with the ornament,
and adore it with the incense, of his own. His interest, though
liberal, is just a trifle utilitarian. He holds, like Scott’s counsellor,
that “a lawyer without history or literature is a mere
mechanic,” and he studies both accordingly; but his study is
mainly a means to an end. He may not be exactly insensible
to the pure beauty of literature in and by itself; but it may be
suspected that, if he spoke of it freely, he would speak in much
the same tone that he uses in an odd passage<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c008'><sup>[418]</sup></a> about working in
the country, where he thinks the beauty of tree and flower, the
song of birds, the sound of streams, likely to distract rather
than to inspire. The prose of the Roman nature, its businesslike
character, its matter-of-factness, all betray themselves a
little in him.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is therefore not wonderful that he embodies for us, in a
vary edifying fashion, that distrust of the Romantic which
appears so often, if not so constantly, in the post-Homeric
classical ages, up to his own time, though soon after it was to
break down in writers like Apuleius. We saw that if he did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>not absolutely dislike or despise, he ignored the romantic element
in Xenophon, that the “seizing” situation of the Ten
Thousand, leaderless though victorious, a handful isolated in the
heart of a hostile country, the moving accidents of their journey
across the mountain walls and through the warlike clans of
Kurdistan, and all the rest, till the sight of the sea, and the
rush to the hill-brow to behold it, and the shout of welcome—even
though the incident be as rhetorical a thing as history and
literature contain—pass entirely unnoticed by him. His astonishing
dismissals of Lucretius (though he may have been prejudiced
by Cicero<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c008'><sup>[419]</sup></a> there) as merely “difficult,” of Catullus as
merely “bitter,” group themselves with this very well. The
grim force of the Lucretian despair, which would so fain persuade
itself to be scientific acquiescence in contemplation from
the temples of the wise, the throb of the Catullian passion, are
not his business. Indeed, what <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>contio</i></span>, what <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>judices</i></span>, would pay
any attention to the drift of the atoms in the void? what
respectable paterfamilias but must highly deprecate verses, not
merely immoral but extravagant, to Ipsithilla and Lesbia,
attempts to reproduce, in sober Latin, the Greek ravings of a
Sappho or about an Attis? Apollonius Rhodius, too, who to
us seems a Romantic before Romanticism, touches no chord in
Quintilian’s breast. And we may be tolerably certain that the
chords which were not responsive in the breast of Quintilian
were at least equally mute in other breasts of his time.</p>

<p class='c001'>But these shortcomings are not only inevitable, they are, for
the purpose of the historian, almost welcome. We may protest
as lovers, but we register and interpret as students. Moreover,
Quintilian, like all the greater men in all periods, and some
even of the smaller in some, supplies us with a great deal of
matter for registration and interpretation, without any protest
at all. In the first place, we see in him the gradual deflection
or development (whichever word may be preferred) of Rhetoric
into pure Literary Criticism, assisted by the practical disappearance
of symbouleutic oratory, by the degradation of epideictic,
and by the practical Roman contempt for mere technicalities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>unless, as in the case of law, they are intimately and almost
inextricably connected with some practical end. It would be
possible, as we have seen, by a process of mere “lifting out,”
with hardly any important garbling of phrase, to extract from
the <cite>Institutions</cite> a “Treatise on Composition and Critical Reading”
which would be of no mean bulk, of no narrow range, and
would contain a very large proportion of strictly relevant and
valuable detail. And this treatise would be illuminated—for
practically the only time, in the range of ancient literature on
the subject, to any considerable extent—by that searchlight of
criticism, the comparative method; while it would also display,
throughout, the other illuminative powers of wide reading, sound
judgment, and an excellent and by no means merely pedestrian
common-sense.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may regret, indeed, as we have regretted already, that
these good gifts were not turned to the business of direct literary
examination of particular books and authors, after the
fashion of Dionysius; but it is quite evident why they were not.
And their actual use has resulted in passage on passage, in
chapter on chapter, of the most precious material. Quintilian
can only be despised by those who consider themselves defrauded
if critics do not attempt the <i>meteorosophia</i> of the highest
æsthetic generalisations. It is, on the other hand, certain that
these airy flights, in this particular matter, have too often had
the ultimate Icarian fate, and have not often met even with
the temporary Icarian success. The “high priori way” has
never led to any permanent conquest in literary criticism; and
it is never likely to do so, because of the blessed infinity and
incalculableness of human genius. It has constantly led that
genius into deserts and <i>impasses</i>. Even things that look like
generalisations firmly based on actual experience have to be
cautiously guarded, and put forth merely as working hypotheses.
You make, with the almost superhuman compound of learning
and reason belonging to an Aristotle, a general theory of Poetry,
and a special one of Tragedy, which require, and command, almost
universal agreement. In a few hundred years there drops in
a graceless sort of prose tale-tellers, who by establishing, slowly
and uncertainly at first, but after a couple of thousand years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>unmistakably, the kind of prose fiction, sap the very foundations
of your theory of poetry. Later still arises a more
graceless sort of strolling actors, ne’er-do-weel university men
in England, cavaliers or shavelings in Spain, who in the same
way bring it about that your theory of tragedy has to acknowledge
itself to be only a theory of one kind of tragedy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other way is the way of safety; and if it be objected that
it is the way of plodders only, one could undertake to make a
very striking company of plodders from Longinus to Mr Arnold,
who, sometimes not quite wittingly or willingly, have done all
their best work in it. It would be but re-summarising our
summary to point out once more, in any fulness, what work
Quintilian has done. He has given us a history in little of the
choicest Greek and Latin literature; he has drawn and placed
for us the contrasted styles, not merely of oratorical, but of all
prose composition; he has handled the literary side of grammar
with singular fairness and sense; and has dealt more satisfactorily—to
us at least—than any other ancient writer with the
all-important and most difficult question of euphony in written
speech. No one among ancient writers has treated the important
but delusive subject of the Figures with more sense and skill; no
one has contrived to get, out of some of the merest technicalities
of the Rhetoric of the Schools, such a solid extract of critical
power. The technical observations in Book X., which for want
of space we passed over rapidly, form the most invaluable <cite>Introduction
to Composition</cite> to be found in any language; they put
our modern books of the kind to shame, at once by the practical
character of their suggestions, and by their freedom from mere
mechanical arbitrariness of prescription on points where idiom,
good usage, and individual ability are really the only arbiters.
And lastly, on the all-important and ever-recurring battle of
the styles, Plain and Ornate, Attic and Asiatic, or whatever
antithesis be preferred, it would be almost impossible to find
a more intelligent pronouncement than Quintilian’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>He can therefore afford to smile at those who say that he
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chancelle sur le terrain des principes</i></span>,<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c008'><sup>[420]</sup></a> and to reply that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>terrain</i></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>is exactly the word which does not apply to the principles with
which he is reproached for not dealing. The only reproach to
which he <em>is</em> perhaps open is one which all antiquity, from
Aristotle to Longinus, and including both these great men, shares
with him. This is the reproach of never completely clearing
up the mind about Rhetoric, and of perpetually confusing it
with the Art of Prose Literature, or else leaving prose literature
without any “art” at all. We have seen, long ago, how this
confusion arose, and how it was maintained by conditions which,
though working more feebly in Quintilian’s days, were still
working. The matter came to a head (though, oddly enough,
the person chiefly concerned seems not quite to have understood
it) when Lucian formally renounced Rhetoric and took to essay-writing
in dialogue, when Apuleius in the <cite>Golden Ass</cite> mingled
declamation, dialogue, philosophy, and romance in one <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>olla
podrida</i></span>, with a daring sauce of new prose style to make it go
down. But the barbarians were then at the gates; and the real
recognition and reconstruction was not to take place for ages
later, if it has completely taken place even yet.</p>

<hr class='c017' />
<div class='footnote' id='f377'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r377'>377</a>. Whether its correct title be <cite>Institutiones
Oratoriæ</cite>, or <cite>De Institutione
Oratoria</cite>, and whether this be better
translated <cite>Principles of Oratory</cite>, or <cite>Of
the Education of an Orator</cite>, are questions
not very important <em>to us</em>. The
sense of “Institutes” may be illustrated
by the old division of academical chairs
in, for instance, Medicine into “Institutes”
(<i>i.e.</i>, “Theory”) and “Practice.”
But Quintilian includes a good deal of
the practical side. All the editions of
Quintilian are either antiquated by, or
more or less based upon, that of Spalding
and Zumpt, with Lexicon, &amp;c., by

<p class='c007'>The period from Nero to Hadrian is not merely the central and
most important period of Latin criticism, but it contains a proportion
altogether disproportionate of the bulk as of the value
of Latin contributions to the subject. We must, however, complete
our view of that subject, before summing up its general
characteristics, with another chapter surveying the yield of the
second, third, and fourth—perhaps, in view of the uncertainty
of date of Martianus, we should add the fifth—centuries. The
crop, if not very abundant, or of the very greatest value, is
neither very scanty nor very uninteresting. It shall consist,
in the specimens of it which we can afford to examine, first of
the two famous and by no means unamusing miscellanists, the
authors of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Noctes Atticæ</cite></span> and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Saturnalia</cite></span>; then, by an
easy transition, of the commentators and scholiasts represented
by their prior Servius, himself an interlocutor in the Macrobian
symposium; in the third place, of a poetical contingent, much
less important indeed than that furnished by the satirists from
Horace to Martial, but not quite insignificant; and lastly, of
the technical rhetoricians, ending with one of their latest representatives,
but perhaps the most interesting of all, Martianus
Capella. The chapter will thus, at least, not lack variety.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>It would be difficult to have a better example of the indisposition
of the Latin mind towards literary criticism proper,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Aulus Gellius: the</i> Noctes Atticæ.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
than that which is afforded by the famous <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Noctes
Atticæ</cite></span> of Aulus Gellius.<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c008'><sup>[421]</sup></a> We know nothing of this
good person except that he was probably of more or
less pure Roman descent, that he probably lived for
the most part of his life at Rome and at Athens in the early
second century, that he was a friend of Herodes Atticus,
probably knew Plutarch, and was extremely intimate with, and
a great admirer of, the rhetorician Favorinus. The well-known
miscellany which he has left us, and which, in purporting to
give the results of study or conversation in an Attic country-house,
has been for seventeen hundred years so fruitful in
imitations—mother, indeed, of a family sometimes a great deal
fairer than herself—is an amusing book and a valuable, because it
preserves for us a great number of quotations from lost authors
or books, because its farrago of matter is good pastime, and not
least because of a certain Pepysian or Boswellian quality in its
author. But though, amid its jumble of things ethical, physical,
logical, legal, and, above all, philological, perhaps the larger
part is occupied with literature or at least with books, it is
quite astonishing how small is the proportion that can be called
literary criticism, and how rudimentary and infantine even that
small proportion is. Gellius had nearly all the qualities and
acquirements of the dictionary-maker; he was interested in
etymology, was a most exact and careful purist in the definition
and usage of words, and evidently prided himself on his collections
of illustrative phrases and passages.<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c008'><sup>[422]</sup></a> But almost invariably
it must be said of him that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>hæret in litera</i></span>, or, if he escapes
that adhesion, that he gives himself over to the substance
and meaning, not to the literary form and art, of what he quotes
and studies. In all the nineteen or twenty books of his work
there are probably not nineteen or twenty pages of real literary
criticism; and where he does give us any it is of the “strawiest”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>character. Take, for instance, his comparison (ii. 23) of the
Greek and Latin comic writers, and especially of some passages
of Cæcilius with their originals in Menander. In preferring
the Greek he is, of course, quite right; but it is noteworthy
that he can hardly render any specific reason for his preference.
He says, vaguely if truly, that the Latins seem low and sordid
beside the wit and brilliancy of the Greeks, that Cæcilius appears
stupid and frigid by Menander. But as to detail he
prudently adds, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nihil dicam ego quantum differat</i></span>; and, less
prudently transgressing this rule later, confines himself wholly
to the matter, accusing the Roman of leaving out a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>simplex et
verum et delectabile</i></span> remark of the Greek. And if he comes a
little nearer in praising (or making his favourite Favorinus
praise) the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>flavum marmor</i></span> of Ennius, it is still pretty clear that
he does this merely or mainly from the side of the dictionary-maker,
pleased at getting a light on the exact meaning of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>flavus</i></span>.
Although to our ears his preference (vi. 20) of “Ora” to
“Nola” (in the passage which Virgil is said to have altered
from a rather petty spite to the Nolans), “because it makes a
sweet hiatus” with <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Vesevo</i></span> at the end of the preceding line, may
seem all wrong, the principle is æsthetic if the application is
not. But, as a rule, we shall find that his critical opinions,
where they are not concerned with purely verbal matters, are
always decided by moral, philosophical, or in some other way
extra-literary considerations. Even in an extremely interesting
passage towards the end (xix. 9) where he makes <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Græci plusculi</i></span>
attack the Spanish-Latin rhetor Antonius Julianus<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c008'><sup>[423]</sup></a> on the score
of the inferiority of Roman to Greek erotic poets, and gives
the passages with which Julianus retorted, the chief interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>for us is that even the Greeks except Catullus to some extent,
and Calvus, from their censure. For there is little or nothing
but logomachy to be got out of the condemnation of Hortensius
as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>invenustus</i></span> and Cinna as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>illepidus</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This same imputation of logomachy is hard to clear from the
dispute in x. 3, whether, though Caius Gracchus is undoubtedly
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fortis et vehemens</i></span>, it is or is not intolerable that he should be
deemed <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>severior</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>amplior</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>acrior</i></span>, than Cicero. If Gellius had
kept to the same words, and had said <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fortior</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vehementior</i></span>,
the observation just made might seem unkind; but as it
is, one seems to be dropping into the well-known jargon of
our own times, and of all times, to be hearing one reviewer
asserting that Johnson is “alert” and another replying that
Thompson is “nimble,” or opposing the “poignancy” of Smith
to the “swiftness” of Brown. But the attention to words
certainly comes in better when the critic objects to the use,
in an otherwise <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>non sane incommode</i></span> adapted version from
Euripides by Ennius, of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ignobiles</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>opulenti</i></span> for ἀδοξοῦντες
and δοκοῦντες. XII. 2, however, is a good <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>locus</i></span> for us in
more ways than one. It opens with a sketch of the difference
of opinion about Seneca in the age succeeding his own,
a difference of which Quintilian had, a little earlier, given
us an inkling. “Some,” says Gellius, “think of him as of
a most unprofitable writer, one not worth reading, because
they hold his style vulgar and hackneyed, his matter and
opinions distinguished either by inept and empty haste (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>impetu</i></span>)
or by frivolous and Old-Bailey (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>causidicali</i></span>) wire-drawing, his
erudition vernacular and plebeian, and possessing nothing either
of the dignity or the grace of the classics. Others, while not
denying that he has little grace of phrase, maintain that his
matter lacks neither information nor teaching power, and that
he has no unhappy gravity and severity in castigating vice.”
He himself will give no general censure, but consider Seneca’s
opinion of Cicero and Ennius and Virgil. This “consideration,”
according to his wont, is rather a string of quotations with
objurgatory epithets than a regular criticism. One may not
agree with Seneca or one may (there are certainly some who
would indorse his confession and avoidance of Cicero’s faults in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>the words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>non ejus sed temporis vitium</i></span>). But the words which
Gellius himself uses—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>insulsissime, homo nugator, inepti et insubidi<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c008'><sup>[424]</sup></a>
hominis joca</i></span>—surely require some little argument to
justify them, and this argument is what Gellius never gives.
We may thank him, however, for the criticism as well as for the
anecdote preserved (xiii. 2) in the story of the meeting of the
tragic poets Pacuvius and Accius at Tarentum, in the extreme
old age of the former. Pacuvius had asked his young guest and
craftsfellow to read his tragedy of <cite>Atreus</cite>, and, after the reading,
praised it as sonorous and grand, but perhaps a little harsh and
austere. “It is so,” said the junior, “but I am not very sorry,
for I hope to improve. It is the same in wits as in fruits: the
hard and harsh mellow and sweeten, but those that are at first
flabby, and soft, and moist, do not ripen but rot. I thought it
best to have something in my genius for time and age to
mitigate.” A sound principle, though not quite a universal one,
as one may see in studying a certain life-work which ranges
from “Claribel” to “Crossing the Bar.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He is in his more meticulous moods when (xiii. 18) he
accuses Plato of misquotation and Euripides of plagiarism; but
a couple of chapters later a set discourse on euphony, starting
from a saying of Valerius Probus, seems to promise well. Some
one had asked Probus whether it was better to use the terminations
<i>em</i> or <i>im</i>, <i>es</i> or <i>is</i>, for the accusative, where both occur.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Aurem tuam interroga</i></span>, said Probus, which is no doubt the
conclusion of the whole matter. But his questioner, either
foolish or dogged, asked how he was to do this, and Probus replied,
“As Virgil did when he wrote <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Urbisne invisere Cæsar</i></span>
but <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Urbes habitant magnas</i></span>.” Nor are we sorry to hear that
when the questioner still bored on, saying that he could not
understand why one should be better in one place and another
in another, Probus retorted, “<em>You</em> need not trouble yourself; it
will do <em>you</em> no harm whatever you use.” <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Prope inclementer</i></span>,
says Gellius (“Served him right,” most of us will say). But he
goes on to accumulate some other instances of this application
of the rule of euphony, and perhaps here draws as near to true
criticism as he ever does. Nor is he wrong, though he may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>fanciful, in deciding in regard to certain almost literal Virgilian
imitations of Homer, that the Greek is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>simplicior et sincerior</i></span>,
Virgil νεωτερικώτερος <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>et quodam quasi ferrumine immisso
fucatior</i></span>.<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c008'><sup>[425]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>He may strain the word again too much, when he bestows a
page on the difference of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>multis hominibus</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>multis mortalibus</i></span>
(xii. 28), but he recovers esteem when in xiv. 6 we find him
rejecting, not without contumely, contributions to his <cite>Noctes</cite> on
the questions “Who was the first grammarian?” and “Why
Telemachus did not nudge his bedfellow Pisistratus but kicked
him?” &amp;c., &amp;c. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Properans reddidi</i></span>, says he, with the shudder
one can fancy, though, to tell the truth, he does himself “something
grow to” this kind of disease.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may close this anthology of the Gellian criticisms with
some account of one of the most elaborate—a discourse of
Favorinus on Pindar and Virgil.<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c008'><sup>[426]</sup></a> After quoting the Roman
poet’s traditional saying about himself—that he brought forth
his verses as a bear does her cubs, licking them slowly and
busily into shape—he points out that the facts exactly bear
out the description, and that certain verses, not having undergone
the process of licking, are very inferior to the others.
Among these unlicked cubs, it seems, Favorinus would place the
Etna passage. Even Pindar himself, whom Virgil followed, is,
the critic thinks, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ipso insolentior tumidiorque</i></span> in the place; but
Virgil’s verse is such that Favorinus calls it “begun, not made.”
And, the two passages having been cited in full, he indulges in
the following drastic verbal censure: “At the very beginning,
Pindar, paying more attention to the truth, said what was the
fact, and a matter of ocular demonstration, that Etna smoked
by day and flamed by night. But Virgil, laboriously seeking
noisy-sounding words, confuses the two. The Greek says plainly
that fountains of fire are belched forth, and rivers of smoke flow,
and yellow, curling volumes of flame are borne down to the
shores of the sea like fiery snakes; but this fellow of ours,
choosing to interpret ῥόον καπνοῦ αἴθωνα by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>atram nubem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>turbine piceo et favilla fumantem</i></span>, makes a crass and clumsy
mixture, and translates the κρουνοὺς of flames, both harshly
and inexactly, into ‘globes.’ Again, when he talks of ‘licking
the stars,’ he makes an idle and empty exaggeration. Nay, the
phrase, ‘emitting a black cloud of smoke full of pitchy whirlwinds
and glowing ashes,’ is bad style and almost nonsense.<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c008'><sup>[427]</sup></a>
For glowing things, quoth he, neither smoke nor are black;
unless by an improper vulgarism he applies <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>candente</i></span>, not to
glowing but to merely ‘hot’ ash. But when he talks of ‘rocks
and cliffs being belched and flung up,’ adding immediately that
they are ‘melted, and groan, and are flung in handfuls into the
air,’ neither did Pindar write this, nor would anybody else think
of saying it, and the thing is the most monstrous of all
monstrosities.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The classical hatred of bombast and the classical propensity
to “stick at the word” in criticism are both very well illustrated
here; but we should hardly guess, from the sample, that
there existed in classical times much power of grasping the
literary and poetical merit of a passage as a whole. Virgil,
if he had cared to defend himself, would, no doubt, have
called attention to the Pindaric words, τέρας and θαῦμα, as
justifying even “monstrosity” in his own expanded description,
and have urged that this description was at least partly intended
to indicate the terror and confusion of mind caused by so
portentous a phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this absence of the synoptic grasp of æsthetic means, as
applied to produce literary effect, is precisely what we notice
most in the ancient criticism which has come down to us. And
it may be added that it is also precisely what we should expect
to follow from the limitations of the ancient Rhetoric. Grammar
provided rules for the arrangement of words, and lexicography
provided lists of them, with their authority and their
use carefully ticketed; so here criticism was at home. Rhetoric
provided lists of Figures with which a man could compare the
passage before him. But there was no training in the process
of simply “submitting to” this passage, interrogating oneself
whether it exercised a charm or not, and then interrogating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>oneself further whether that charm was genuine, and what was
its cause. After all, Gellius has, as we have seen, sometimes
come near to the discovery of the true method, and that he
loved literature there can be no doubt.<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c008'><sup>[428]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Nor, much later, shall we find things different with that
favourite of the Middle Ages and of Dr Johnson’s youth,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Macrobius: The</i> Saturnalia.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Macrobius,<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c008'><sup>[429]</sup></a> who, about the beginning of the fifth
century, undertook a pendant to the work of Gellius.
It is not surprising that the author, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>qui ot nom
Macrobes</i></span>,<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c008'><sup>[430]</sup></a> should have been a favourite (for his commentary on
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Somnium Scipionis</cite></span> principally, no doubt) with the period
between Darkness and Renaissance. He has precisely the “fine
confused feeding” in the way of matter and manner that these
ages loved; and they would not be likely to quarrel with him
for his lack of the criticism which, as we shall see, they themselves
hardly, in more than a single instance, relished or understood.
But he certainly illustrates, even in a greater degree
than Gellius, the small propulsion of the Romans and their
vassals towards the proper subjects of this book. Once more
we find that etymology, mythology, grammar, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>farrago</i></span> of the
antiquary as distinguished from that of the literary enthusiast,
of the philologist as opposed to the critic, receive ample
attention. And, once more, what we are specially in quest of
remains practically, if not entirely, unhandled.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are few more striking <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>loci</i></span> in connection with this
subject than the end of the first book of the <cite>Saturnalia</cite>.
The guests have been talking mythology and etymology for
some stricken hours, till at last a break occurs. Vettius
Prætextatus, the host, has just ended a long mythological
dissertation, to the admiration of everybody, when Euangelus
(the irreverent humourist of the party) breaks in, with some
amusement at the practice of citing Virgil as an authority.
He supposes that the notion of making Latin poets into philosophers
is an imitation of the Greeks, and hints that the process
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>is dangerous, since even Tully himself, who was as formal a
professor of philosophising as of oratory, so often as he talks of
the nature of the gods, or of fate, or of divination, injures the
glory which he has got together through his eloquence, by his
desultory handling of things. Symmachus, the scholar-statesman,
rebukes this blasphemer gravely, observing that, as for
Cicero, he is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>conviciis impenetrabilis</i></span>, and may be left aside for
the moment, but that he fears Euangelus has learnt his Virgil
only as boys do, and thinks him only good for boys, with
nothing higher in him. Euangelus is by no means abashed, and
takes the offensive. It was all very well, he says, for us as
boys to take Virgil at our master’s valuation, but did not he
himself pronounce himself far from faultless, inasmuch as he
wished them to burn the <cite>Æneid</cite>? No doubt he was afraid,
not merely of ethical blame for such scenes as the request
of Venus to her lawful husband in favour of her illegitimate
son, but of critical blame for his now Greek, now barbarous,
diction, and for the awkward <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ordonnance</i></span> of his work. To this,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cum omnes exhorruissent</i></span>, Symmachus, still calm and sententious,
makes answer by putting Virgil beside Cicero, and saying of
his glory, that as it can grow by no one’s praise, so it is
diminished by no one’s abuse. Any grammarian, he continues,
can refute these calumnies; and it would be a shame to ask
Servius (the famous Virgilian scholiast, who is present) to
take the trouble. But he should like to know whether, as
Euangelus is dissatisfied with Virgil’s Poetic, he likes his
Rhetoric better. “Oh!” says Euangelus, “you have made
him a philosopher, and now you are going to make him an
orator, are you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>A conversation of this kind gives us no bad reason to expect
something like literary criticism proper, something such as
Coleridge has given us in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Biographia Literaria</cite></span> in reference
to Wordsworth. But Symmachus for the time contents himself
with undertaking to defend the Mantuan’s rhetoric, while
the others overwhelm the impenitent Euangelus with a string
of affirmations as to the poet’s proficiency in politics, law,
augury, astrological and other philosophy, fidelity to the traditions
of the Latin language, &amp;c. But the justifications of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>praises are deferred by the announcement of dinner, and for a
time the conversation turns to lighter subjects—the famous
string of stories for which Macrobius is most commonly quoted,
including scandal about Princess Julia. Only in the third
book, and then, it would seem, after a lacuna, is the detailed
criticism of Virgil resumed.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no occasion to find fault with the quantity of it, for
it fills, with a digression or two of the lighter kind, such as that
on the dessert when it appears, four whole books, and some two
hundred and forty pages in Eyssenhardt’s text. But the quality
is, at any rate from our point of view, not quite so satisfactory.
Much simply consists in citation of passages illustrating different
“Figures.” A very large part, probably the largest, is mere
and sheer quotation from Virgil himself, from Homer, and from
other poets, Latin and Greek, with whom he is compared. And
the comparison is carried on almost, if not quite entirely, on that
most unsatisfying parallel-passage system which, in its abuse,
has ever since been the delight of the pedantic criticaster—and
the abomination of the true critic.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course the parallel passage, rightly handled, is invaluable—is
practically indispensable to true literary criticism. The
“Truth” passages of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Areopagitica</cite></span> and Halifax’s <cite>Character of
a Trimmer</cite>, the “Death” passages of Raleigh, Marston, and
Lee, the different harmonies which the motive “Ask me no
more” has suggested to Carew and Tennyson, the accounts of
the passing of Arthur or the parting of Lancelot and Guinevere
in Malory, and in his probable verse original, are the constant,
the inexhaustible, texts and exercises of the critical faculty.
But I do not think it unfair to Macrobius to say that hardly in
a single occasion does he make any such use of his parallels.
And in literary criticism, properly so called, such parallels as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>are all but valueless. They merely show what might be demonstrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>once for all in a page—what does not need demonstrating
to any intelligent person who has read fifty lines of the two
poets—that Virgil was an excellent translator, and was, rather
more frequently than becomes a great poet, content simply to
translate.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rest of the matter lies, for the most part if not wholly, as
much as this or more in the uttermost precincts of literary
criticism proper. The illustrations of Virgil’s attention to that
religious ritual and liturgical language which was so important
at Rome are very curious, very interesting, very valuable but
they scarcely touch the fringe of literature: a Roman Blackmore
could be as prolific of them as the Roman Dryden.</p>

<p class='c001'>The contents of Book IV. may, perhaps, be urged against me;
and I shall confess that they come nearer to a certain conception
of literary criticism. But I should reply that this conception
itself is an argument on the side I am taking. One of the gaps,
common at the opening of the books of the <cite>Saturnalia</cite>, plunges
us into the midst of a demonstration of Virgil’s pathos, that
word being sometimes used in the Greek plural <i>pathe</i>, and referring
to the Rhetorical “passions” appealed to. We find,
however, almost directly, that the citations are only applied to
illustrate and enforce Virgil’s technical command of rhetoric, as
Symmachus had foreshadowed. The parts are accordingly dealt
out in the orthodox way between accuser and defendant, and
the passages quoted are distributed once more under figures—Irony,
Hyperbole, and the rest. This, of course, is literary criticism
after a fashion, though a fashion which Quintilian had
already treated with some disdain (abandoning it almost entirely
in the best parts of his own critical work), and which Longinus,
though he too was not quite bold enough to discard it entirely,
avoids, either cunningly or instinctively, in all his best passages.
Macrobius and his distinguished company seem to wish for
nothing better, and after they have complacently ticked off the
sorts and sources of the pathos—time, place, circumstance, age,
mood, manner, and so forth—they decide triumphantly, at the
beginning of the Fifth Book, that Virgil must be held no less
of an orator than of a poet. Indeed, Eusebius, who has conducted
the rhetorical inquiry, draws a neat parallel between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Virgil and Cicero himself. The eloquence, he says, of the
Mantuan is multiplex and multiform, and comprehends every
kind of speech. In your Cicero [Eusebius of course is a Greek]
there is one tenor of eloquence, the abundant, and torrential, and
copious. For the nature of orators is not uniform, but one
flows and overflows, another affects a brief and concise manner.
The thin and dry and sober speaker loves, as it were, a parsimony
of words, his rival revels in full and florid and amply
illustrated rhetoric. Virgil is the only man who, while others
are so dissimilar, blends his own eloquence of every kind. And
he subsequently distributes these kinds more specially to Cicero,
Sallust, Fronto, and the younger Pliny. The passage which
follows, for three or four pages, till the scoffer Euangelus brings
on the Homeric parallels by asking whether they think a
Venetian farmer’s boy is likely to have known Greek literature,
is one of the most literary in the book. But it is (as a devil’s
advocate must point out) curious and a little unfortunate that
once more we find the subject drawn, as it were, irresistibly to
the oratorical side. In no other branch of literature, it seems,
could a Roman or a late Greek (which Macrobius probably was)
taste the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>minutiæ</i></span> of difference, the savours and qualities which
concern criticism proper. Elsewhere he “stuck in letters,” or
in Figures, or in the merest schematic construction of prosody,
or in the matter, as opposed to the form and spirit, of the
literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another piece of criticism, proper if not consummate, will be
found in the seventeenth chapter of the Fifth Book, in the shape
of a fresh comparison, to be itself compared with that cited
above from Gellius, between Pindar’s Ætna, in the First Pythian
and Virgil’s in the third <cite>Æneid</cite>. It is an even weaker piece.
For the critic, a Greek, cavils at Virgil quite in the Rymer-and-Dennis
style, not merely because he speaks of an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>atram
nubem</i></span> as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fumantem candente favilla</i></span>, but (exactly as if he were
an eighteenth-century French critic speaking of Shakespeare)
because the poet actually indulges in such shocking words as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>eructans</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Sixth Book deals with Virgil’s borrowing of diction and
phrase from the older Latin poets, and has, of course, great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>linguistic, and a certain portion of literary, interest. But it is
again remarkable how little this latter is improved or worked
out. As in the Homeric case, the literary interest of the fact
that Virgil was content simply to “lift” Ennian phrases, like
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>stellis fulgentibus</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tollitur in cælum clamor</i></span>, is limited to the
demonstration that Virgil “stole his brooms ready made,” as the
Berkshire broom-squire did. And no attempt is made (as might
easily have been done, and in fairness to Virgil should have
been done) to show the taste with which the poet selected beautiful
words and happy phrases. Servius, later in the book, has
some not uninteresting verbal criticism, but attempts nothing
more. In fact, in all this bulk of work there is not as much
literary criticism in the proper sense as Longinus has often
given us in a paragraph, and hardly an attempt at even that
general characterisation which we find sometimes in Gellius
and still more in Quintilian. The place and power of Virgil
remain untouched, or are referred to only in the vaguest conventionalisms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Servius on Virgil.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>One of the contributors, as has been said, to the Macrobian
symposium is no less a person than Maurus (or Marius) Servius
Honoratus, the greatest commentator on the greatest
Latin poet in general repute, and obviously, from the
figure he makes in the <cite>Saturnalia</cite>, a man held in very high
esteem for erudition and ability. We have his commentary,<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c008'><sup>[431]</sup></a>
together with those of other ancient commentators of less
repute. They are extremely voluminous;<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c008'><sup>[432]</sup></a> they are, and always
have been, justly respected for their value in the interpretation
of the poet. Servius had before him, and undoubtedly used, a
very large bulk of precedent annotation, and represents, almost
fully, the “Variorum” editor of modern times. We might therefore
expect to find in him, if not something like the proceedings
and results of Mr Furness in his <cite>Shakespeare</cite>, at any rate something
like those of the Johnson-Malone time. Let us see what
we actually do find. He gives us, at the very first, a definition
of the duties of a critical editor, in which, on the face of it,
there is very little to blame. The life of the poet; the titles of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>work; the quality of the poem; the intention of the writer; the
number of the books, the order of them, the explanation of them.
Looking at this off-hand, one may wonder a little at the elevation
to co-ordinate honours of the number and order of the books, and
of course perceive that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>qualitas carminis</i></span>, the critical point, is susceptible
of rather widely differing interpretations as a promise.
In the vague modern sense of “quality”—a sense, too, not absolutely
unknown in ancient times—it covers by itself almost
all that the most accomplished and wide-ranging criticism—the
criticism of Coleridge or of Arnold, of Hazlitt or of Sainte-Beuve—can
extend unto. In the narrow technical sense of the Greek
ποιότης, it comes to very little more than the mere technical
classification of the piece as epic or what not, and offers us food
as little sappy with critical juice as the most arid distinctions
of Rhetoric.</p>

<p class='c001'>But we have barely turned a page when the sense in which
Servius understands the comparative extent of the duties he
has so lucidly mapped out breaks upon us. The “life,” brief and
business-like, leaves no special room for complaint except to
anecdote-mongers. But all the rest, except the “explanation,”
is huddled up in less than a page, and in forms as succinct as the
answers to a catechism. Title? “Æneis,” derived from Æneas,
cf. Juvenal’s “Theseis.” Quality? Quite clear: the metre is
heroic, the action “mixed” (<i>i.e.</i>, the poet sometimes speaks himself,
sometimes introduces others speaking). It is also Heroic,
because it contains a mixture of divine and human things, of
truth and fiction. For Æneas really did come to Italy, but
clearly the poet made it up<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c008'><sup>[433]</sup></a> when he represented Venus speaking
to Jupiter, or the mission of Mercury. The style is grandiloquent—that
is to say, the phrase is lofty and the sentiments
noble. Besides, are there not three kinds of speaking, the low,
the middle, the grand? This is the grand style. Virgil intended
first to imitate Homer, then to magnify the ancestry of
Augustus (proofs of this latter given). Here there is no dispute
about the number of the author’s books, though in other cases
(such as that of Plautus) there is. And there is not much
doubt about the order, though a mere crotcheteer might put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>them in the order 2, <a href='#Page_3'>3</a>, <a href='#Page_1'>1</a>, in his ignorance that the art of the poet
consists in beginning at the middle and anticipating the future
(see Horace). This shows that Virgil was a skilful bard. That
is all. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Sola superest explanatio quæ in sequenti expositione probabitur.</i></span></p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Sola superest explanatio!</i></span> All, except the mere verbal part, is
swept aside, as settled and done for, in these thirty or forty lines.
Of the <em>quality</em>, in the fuller and higher sense, of the Virgilian
art nothing; nothing of its comparative value even with that of
Homer himself, still less of other Greeks, or with that of Ennius,
of Lucretius, of Statius, of the scores of Roman epic or “heroic”
poets whom and whose books Servius had before him, while
their names only are before us. Nothing of his way of managing
his metre, his diction, his prosopop&oelig;ia, his scenery, his dialogue.
And in the settlement of the questions that are attacked, the
most schoolboy-like abstinence from anything but reference to
stock authorities, stock classifications. Nothing, for instance,
one would think, would be easier and more attractive, for a man
who thinks that Virgil’s is the grand style, than to prove it to
be so, nothing more curious and fascinating than to reply to
the objections of those who think it is not, if there be such
heretics (and, as we know from the Euangelus of the <cite>Saturnalia</cite>,
there were such, even in those days). But no glimpse or
glimmer of any such thing enters the mind of our scholiast.
There are, everybody allows, three styles: Low, Middle, and
Grand. Nobody calls Virgil low; you surely would not call
him middle; therefore he must be grand. Q.E.D.; and demonstrated
it is most mathematically. Then what kind of poem is
it? You run your finger down the official list of kinds and find
“Heroic; written in hexameters and dealing with mixed kinds.”
Virgil is in hexameters, but <em>is</em> he mixed? Let us run the careful
finger down yet another table, “Mixed: that which is
partly divine and partly human, partly false, partly true.”
Let us see whether this will apply to Virgil. It does. Then
Virgil is Heroic. Next, about order and so forth. Ought not
Books II. and III., which tell the voyage of Æneas up to the
events recorded in the opening of Book I., to come before it?
This gives a moment’s pause, but let us look at our Horace—<i>Ut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>jam nunc dicat</i>, and so forth. Once more, we need not trouble
ourselves: the order is all right.</p>

<p class='c001'>To some readers this account may savour of flippancy; and
to them it is impossible to offer any excuse. To others, who
may not be likely to take the trouble to read Servius for themselves,
it will be enough to say that practically nothing is put in
his mouth which he does not say, that his method is hardly
caricatured even in form. It is one of the best illustrations we
have, or could reasonably expect to have, of the whole system
of ancient criticism, save in its very greatest examples, and to
some extent even in these. You construct, or accept from
tradition as already constructed, a vast classification of terms
and kinds, hierarchically arranged; and when a subject presents
itself you simply refer it to the classification. Practically no
intellectual labour is required, and still less—a mere minus
quantity indeed—of cultivation of the æsthetic sentiment. The
necessary cards, with the necessary descriptions on them, are in
cell B or A, compartment <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>, case 3 or 5, room <span class='fss'>I.</span> or <span class='fss'>VI.</span>
You take them out and you tie them on, and there’s an end of
the matter. Nay, some fifteen hundred years after Servius,
there are other authorities who conduct criticism—and are indignant
when it is not conducted—in the very self-same way.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, it may be said, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>superest explanatio</i></span>; the explanation does
remain, and there may be much in that. In point of bulk there
is very much; in point of value there is a great deal; but in
point of strict criticism there is simply nothing, though the same
reference to card, and cell, and compartment, and case abounds,
as thus:—</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Arma virumque.</i></span> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Arma</i></span> means “war”: it is the trope called
Metonymy. So <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>toga</i></span>, for “peace,” see Cic. As for <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Arma virumque</i></span>,
it is another figure—that by which we change the order:
some call it Hyperbaton. The whole phrase is a professive
poetic beginning; <i>Musa</i>, &amp;c., an invocative, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>urbs antiqua</i></span> a
narrative. As for <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>virum</i></span>, he does not mention the name, but
indicates the person circumstantially. And now, as Thackeray
says somewhere, “we know all about it, and can proceed” to
write the exordium of an Æneid.</p>

<p class='c001'>Far, very far, be it from me to speak with any ignorant or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>vulgar contempt of Servius. His erudition is very great; his
verbal expositions are almost always very sound and grammatical;
but for him we should lack a whole world of traditional
information, without which the meaning of Virgil would
either be entirely dark to us, or attainable only by the rashest
of guesswork. And it must be admitted that according to the
“figure” system of criticising he is, as the Roman orators say,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>accuratissimus</i></span>. When Virgil, as he so often does, borrows a
phrase from Ennius with a slight alteration, Servius points out
that it is an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>acyrologia</i></span>, and no doubt feels much comforted by
the fact. Something else is an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>amblysia</i></span> (a “blunting,” lessening,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>litotes</i></span>). There are derivations, anticipating the modern
philologist, of the most scientific kind, as that of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>consilia</i></span> for
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>considia</i></span>, because people’s minds become quieter when they sit
down. There is, indeed, a very great deal of miscellaneous
information of all kinds.</p>

<p class='c001'>But of criticism nothing, or less than nothing. Occasionally,
at the beginning of the books, it does seem to occur to the excellent
commentator that something more may be expected of
him. Especially, and indeed most naturally, is this the case
with the Fourth. He tells us, quite properly, that Apollonius had
written an <cite>Argonautica</cite>, and that the whole book is borrowed
from it.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c008'><sup>[434]</sup></a> It is; a fact of which those persons who (having
better knowledge than Dante had) still take Virgil for a
supreme poet might perhaps take more notice than they have
usually taken. But to Servius, and persons of Servius’ way of
thinking, there would not have been much in this. He goes on.
It is almost entirely in affection, though it has pathos in the end,
where the departure of Æneas begets sorrow. It consists entirely
in counsels and subtleties. The style is very nearly
comic—which is not surprising, considering that it treats of love.
But there is a proper junction with the former book, which is a
proof of art, as we have often said. An abrupt transition is a
bad transition, though some people foolishly say that this
junction is not well managed, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>Grant that Virgil shows his want of originality by his relying
on Apollonius. Grant that in the delineation of Dido’s tragic
“All for Love and the World well Lost” for such a tame
scoundrel as Æneas, he has none of the lightning strokes of
Lucretius or Catullus. Yet most of us think that the Fourth
book is a great thing, some that it is a much greater thing
than the <cite>Æneid</cite> of which it forms part. Servius might think,
was entitled to think, and has the consent of many respectable
moderns in thinking, differently. But it does not appear that
he thought about it at all. He found in his books a distinction
between “affection” and “pathos,” and applied it. He had
learnt from the same books that Love was an inferior subject,
Comedy an inferior style, and the former a proper theme of the
latter. So the Fourth book, with its steady rise towards the
hopeless, the hapless, the inevitable end, is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pæne comicus</i></span>. Certainly
the criticism is, from our point of view.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the very value of Servius, as of so many other writers, is
precisely this, that he is <em>not</em> writing from our point of view, that
he is writing from a point of view entirely different. When he
annotates <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Est in secessu</i></span> “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Topothesia</i> est</span>—<i>i.e.</i>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fictus secundum
poeticam licentiam locus.... Nam <i>topographia</i> est rei veræ
descriptio,”</span> it may be difficult to repress a smile. So also
when he points out, in respect to one of Anna’s speeches to
Dido, not that it is touching, or eloquent, or indicative of a
wonderful knowledge of the human heart, and an equally
wonderful grasp of pathetic expression, but that it is regular
Rhetoric—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>suasione omni parte plena; nam purgat objecta, et
ostendit utilitatem, et a timore persuadet</i></span>. But, after all, he is
only playing his own game, not ours. It is impossible, or at
any rate very difficult, to be sure whether it is in innocent
unconsciousness or dry humour that he quotes, without comment,
the objection to the phrase <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nepos Veneris</i></span> that it is unbecoming
to represent Venus as a grandmother. Again, in one of his short
prefaces to the Seventh book—at the point when, to modern
readers, the interest of the <cite>Æneid</cite> is all but over, and the
romantic wanderings of Æneas, the passion of the Fourth book,
the majesty and magnificence of the Sixth, are exchanged for
the kite-and-crow battles of Trojans and Rutulians, the doll-like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>figure of Lavinia, and the unjust fate of the hero Turnus at the
hands of a divinely helped invader—he tells us that the earlier
books have been like the <cite>Odyssey</cite> (as indeed they are), not because
of the romantic interest, which of course he did not see, but as
being <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>graviores varietate personarum et allocutionum</i></span>, while the
last books are like the <cite>Iliad</cite>, as being <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>negotiis validiores</i></span>!</p>

<p class='c001'>So, again, the relatively long preface to the <cite>Bucolics</cite> tells us
that the word comes from the Greek for oxen, which are the
principal rustical animals; that these poems were invented in the
time of Xerxes, when the Laconians (one does not quite see
why, as Xerxes never landed in the Peloponnese) were kept to
their walls or the mountains; that the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>qualitas</i></span> is a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>humilis
character</i></span>, thus, with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>medius</i></span> of the <cite>Georgics</cite>, vindicating all
the three styles for Virgil. For we must not require lofty
speaking from humble rustics. He then gives us a curious
specimen of the critical punctiliousness in matters of mint,
anise, and cumin which accompanied blindness to weightier
things. In bucolic verse there ought, it seems, to be a pause
at the fourth foot; and if that foot is a dactyl so much the
better; and it is better also that the first foot should be a dactyl
and included in the word, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>For a final specimen he tells us, in the corresponding
introduction to the <cite>Georgics</cite> themselves, that as Virgil had
followed Homer, and had not come near him in the <cite>Æneid</cite>, as
he had followed Theocritus and run a good second in the
<cite>Eclogues</cite>, so he followed Hesiod, and “simply left him” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>penitus
reliquit</i></span>) in the <cite>Georgics</cite>. It required enormous skill to do
what he has done. (So far so good, but before very long we
come again to the parting of the ways.) The book is didactic,
and therefore it should be written to somebody, for teaching
presupposes two personages—the teacher and the taught. Again,
one does not know whether to smile or not, to take the matter
gravely and urge that any <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lector benevolus</i></span> will occupy quite
sufficiently the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>personam discipuli</i></span>, or to pass the matter, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>olli
subridens</i></span>, and reflecting that our legs also are not unexposed
to the arrows.</p>

<p class='c001'>It can scarcely be necessary to take special examples from
the minor commentators on Virgil or on other Latin poets: for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>their characteristics are, so far as I know, exactly uniform with
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Other commentators.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
those of Servius and with those of the Greek scholiasts.
In explanation of words and things diligent
to admiration, and extremely serviceable, if not always (according
to modern standards, which are very likely temporary) scientific.
In matters of prosody excellently minute and regular,
though occasionally a little arbitrary. Not very seldom careful,
to an almost touching extent, of referring phrases to the accepted
categories of Figure, and applying the stock Rhetorical
divisions and classifications. But not merely in the higher,
but even in the middle regions of criticism proper, so meagre
that they may almost be called entirely to seek. Quite rudimentary
in Comparison; in indicating character, content to
accept stock divisions, and not even attempting individual
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>signalement</i></span>. Abstaining with such uniformity that one can
easily perceive the entire absence of any demand for it, from,
any attempt to deal with the literary beauty of phrase or of
passage, to bring out its effect on the reader, to estimate it as
a work of art, like a picture or a statue. And now and then,
as we have seen, not merely not applying the right, but applying
totally wrong, tests to literature and especially to poetry, demanding
from this latter compliance with the arbitrary requirements
of traditional Rhetoric, and praising it for such compliance.
Are they to be blamed for all this? Certainly not; no one is
to be blamed for not doing what he never intended to do and
what nobody wanted him to do, for doing what was his commission
and his business. But they are to be cited, and examined,
and recorded as witnesses to prove that, for the most
part at any rate, criticism, in the best and highest sense, was
what no critic thought of giving, and no reader thought of
demanding, under the Latin dispensation.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may not be uninteresting to accompany (as we did in the
case of Greek) this view of the later criticism, more or less
formal, with some account of the poets where they touch the
subject. These touches are not frequent or important, but
we find some in Ausonius for the end of the fourth century,
and in the curious collection bearing (with what imparity of
suggested contrast!) the title of the Latin Anthology, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>supposed to have been put together at Carthage, at the end
of the fifth, or a little later.</p>

<p class='c001'>The unequal and decadent, but sometimes fascinating, author<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c008'><sup>[435]</sup></a>
of the <cite>Mosella</cite> and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Cupido cruci affixus</i></span>, of the two charming
epigrams to wife and mistress—</p>

<p class='c022'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Uxor vivamus,”</span></p>

<p class='c023'>and</p>

<p class='c022'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Deformem quidam te dicunt, Crispa”</span>—</p>

<p class='c023'>has, in his epigrams themselves, followed Martial in directions
where he is a less blameless guide than in his literary criticism.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ausonius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But he has not followed him here; and though
much of the collection is simply a translation of
the Greek Anthology, I do not remember any literary following
thereof. But the curious verse celebration of what we may call
the University of Bordeaux, with its “commemoration,” in
separate pieces of varying length and metre, of a couple of
dozen of Professors; the Fourth Idyll, to his namesake and
grandson on his studies; and the Epistles, especially those to
Paullus the Rhetor and to Tetradius, all have more or less to
do with the subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>We find, and are not surprised to find, that of the Professors
at Bordeaux the majority are Professors of Rhetoric. Compliment
has naturally rather the better of criticism in the
addresses to them, but certain things emerge. Tib. Victor
Minervius is “another Quintilian,” especially for fluency and
for the <cite>Demosthenicum</cite> (I suppose δεινότης); but it is a little
suspicious that the fullest praise is given to his <em>memory</em>.
Latinus Alcimus Alethius seems to have been himself a careful
critic, and appears to have written specially on Sallust
and on the Emperor Julian—perhaps the books are somewhere?
Attius Patera was “a descendant of the Druids,”
and we should have been glad to know whether he displayed
that “Celtic spirit” in literature of which we have heard
more than enough in these days. But Ausonius is vague as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>the Celtic vague itself. Attius Tiro Delphinius was a poet
as well as an orator. Others—the dead Luciolus, Alethius
Minervius the Younger, the Grammarian Lentulus, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cognomine
Lascivus</i></span>” (quite innocent, Ausonius tells us), his brother Jucundus,
are more generally commended. Pieces, two grouped and
some single, to the Greek and the Latin grammarians of Bordeaux—show
that the languages, as well as the literatures,
received plentiful attention. The compliment to Exuperius
of Toulouse goes closer, and is decidedly double-edged.<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c008'><sup>[436]</sup></a> Erudition
is specially attributed to Staphylius, who knew not
only Livy and Herodotus, but “all that is stored in the
thousand volumes of Varro” (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sexcentis</i></span>, of course). It is observable
that the grammarians<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c008'><sup>[437]</sup></a> appear to have chiefly lectured
on poetry, the Rhetors on prose, and the whole, with touches
numerous, if not very definite, suggests to us a study liberal
enough, but perhaps not very wide, rather undiscriminating.
The Idyll to his nephew enters naturally into a few more
particulars. A generous but general incitement to the study
of the tongues is followed by detail. The, as it seems to us,
very odd conjunction of Homer and Menander is an additional
testimony to the popularity of the great New Comic. It can
hardly be accidental, for it is separated by some lines from
any other mention. In fact, Ausonius is not prodigal of names,
only those of Horace, Virgil, and Terence being mentioned
for Latin poetry, and the work, though not the name, of
Sallust, with some other histories of the last Republican
period. Lastly, the Epistles, besides supplying fresh instances
of Ausonius’ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rococo</i></span> fancy for the cento—even the Macaronic
cento—supply a perhaps humorous prose criticism in form of
his own work, which is worth subjoining.<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c008'><sup>[438]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Anthologia Latina</cite></span>,<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c008'><sup>[439]</sup></a> which a certain noble youth of the
name of Octavian composed at the bidding of some Vandal
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Anthologia Latina.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
chieftain, perhaps as late as 532, at the extreme
verge of the twilight of the West, is not entirely
deserving of the transferred sense attached to its patron’s
nationality. It has preserved one or two pretty things for
us, and more curious ones. And, in our particular relation,
it shows that literary society and occupation had by no
means gone wholly out of fashion. Both with individuals
and coteries Virgil was a perversely favourite subject; and
the deplorable persons who called themselves the Twelve
Wise Men wrote distichs, and pentastichs, and polystichs,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à dormir debout</i></span>, on the contents of the books of the <cite>Æneid</cite>
and other subjects. The epigrams attributed to Seneca are
probably, whether they belong to any of the known Senecas
or not, of an older and better time; and the pair (Nos. 27
and 28) on the theme of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ære perennius</i></span>, though the sentiment
is of course a commonplace, have a grip and ring of style
which, at any rate after the flaccid barbarisms of the sixth
century, shows well. But for the literary taste of this time
itself, the works of a certain Luxorius (a contemporary it would
seem, and, from the word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>spectabilis</i></span>, probably of official rank)
are most valuable. They are of some bulk, consisting of not
much less than a hundred pieces, filling some forty pages in
Baehrens’s edition. The body of the work, according to the
usual <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>prava docilitas</i></span> of the epigrammatist, consists of things
licentious or trivial enough; but Luxorius had read his Martial
in this respect more closely than Ausonius, that he begins
with three or four pieces of a critical or semi-critical kind.
He is thoroughly convinced of the danger of writing after
the ancients; but, as he says with some force to the Reader,
“If you think them of better quality, why don’t you read them
and not me?” He consoles his book, should it meet with contempt
at Rome and Carthage, with the observation that things
must be content with their proper places; and in a fourth piece
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>pleads that if his epigrams are short, why, the reading will be
the sooner finished. The tone, with a good deal less disguised
conceit, is very much that of a literary <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>abbé</i></span> or President of the
eighteenth century—a kind of person with whose general tastes,
literary and other, Luxorius would probably have sympathised
well enough.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may now complete our survey of the actual documents
by dealing with such remnants as we have of the technical
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Latin Rhetoricians.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
treatises on Rhetoric in Latin. These are neither
numerous nor bulky, nor, with one exception at the
very end of the classical, and gate of the mediæval, period (to
which latter some of them even belong), of much interest or
importance. The fact may seem a little surprising, in face of
the immense interest in the practice of the subject, which
not merely Seneca, and Quintilian, and Pliny, but all others,
show. But the surprise will vanish at a little consideration.
Before the Romans attempted it, the technical part of Rhetoric
had been reduced, as we saw, to a settled scheme of extreme
intricacy by the Greeks, and these claimed to be as much the
masters of the subject as Jews were of Medicine in the Middle
Ages. Probably every Roman, though he might attend his
own countrymen’s declamations, learnt the art of Rhetoric
from a Greek professor at one time or another, and was
familiar with the Greek <i>technæ</i>. It was only after the separation
of the Empires, and not even immediately then, that
Greek ceased to be the language of education. Moreover, the
Romans, though of orderly and business-like habits of thought,
had neither the liking nor the language suited for the intenser
and minuter technicalities of the Art.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be almost sufficient justification of the last paragraph
to mention that the whole body of Latin Rhetoricians, as given
in the standard edition of Capperonnier,<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c008'><sup>[440]</sup></a> fills but a volume of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>some 400 not very large quarto pages; and that this is made up
by the insertion not merely of the Rhetorical part of Martianus
Capella, but of such purely mediæval or “Dark Age” work as
that of Bede, Isidore, and possibly Alcuin. These latter will
find better place in the next Book. Martianus shall be noticed
by himself presently; we may meanwhile run over the rest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first in order, and perhaps the oldest, is the Treatise on
the Figures of P. Rutilius Lupus, a rhetorician often quoted
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Rutilius Lupus, &amp;c.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
by Quintilian. It is in the dictionary form, but
not alphabetically arranged. The definitions are
technical, meagre, and chiefly limited to that jejune splitting
of kinds which has been noticed under the head of Greek. The
illustrative quotations, which are numerous and not useless,
are wholly from Greek authors, many of them indicating by
their time that the Gorgias, whose four books Quintilian tells
us that Rutilius abstracted into one, was not the sophist of
Leontini, but a later Athenian rhetorician. Except for the
close connection which—until quite recently if not still—has
existed between the Figures and criticism, this has little interest
for us.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next treatise, that of Aquila Romanus, is in the same
way only a Latin accommodation of the work of Alexander (<i>v.
supra</i>, p. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>). It is of the same class, a non-alphabetical
dictionary in miniature, and devoted to the same subject.
Of the same class again, exactly, is the tractate of Julius
Rufinianus, who, since he keeps, as Rutilius and Aquila had
not done, the Greek words <i>schema</i> for <i>figura</i>, and <i>lexis</i> for
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>elocutio</i></span>, was probably a closer adapter, paraphrast, or translator
of his original even than they. He has added a short parallel
treatment of the other division of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>schemata</i></span>, the intellectual or
dianoetic.</p>

<p class='c001'>Curius or Chirius Fortunatianus (a writer at any rate senior
to Cassiodorus, who epitomised him) was more ambitious,
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Curius Fortunatianus: his Catechism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and instead of confining himself to the Figures,
composed a regular art of the Rhetoric of the
Schools in three books. It supplies an interesting
and early example of the catechetical form which
was so popular during the middle ages, which continued to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>flourish till within the memory of the present generation,
and the disuse of which has certainly been accompanied by
a loss in exactness of actual knowledge, compensated, or not,
by a gain in the philosophical character of such as is acquired.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Q. What is Rhetoric? A. The science of speaking well.
Q. What is an orator? A. A good man skilled in speaking.
Q. What is the duty of an orator? A. To speak well in civil
cases. Q. What is his end? A. To persuade so far as the
condition of things and persons allows.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And so forth—the writer proceeding by the simple method
of throwing into catechism-form the same kind of dictionary
matter which we have just noticed, sometimes with very odd
effect, as in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Quæ est anæschyntos?</i></span>—a question which, if Mrs.
Quickly had heard it and had understood Greek, would doubtless
have made her adjust to the occasion her objection to
“Jenny’s case.” The thing, though curious, drags Rhetoric
farther out of its proper course than ever, and one perhaps at
no time feels more inclined to join in the contempt of scholastic
methods, mistaken as one knows it to be, than when reading
such questions as—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Assumpta qualitas facit statum?</i></span> and the rest
of this liturgy of abracadabra in catechetical form. In no
rhetorical treatise, indeed, is the question of style so unceremoniously
ignored. A long handling of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>staseis</i></span> is followed
by shorter ones of other technical divisions, “Elocution”
receiving the most perfunctory treatment possible (though with
a certain practicality). How are you to acquire diction? By
reading, speaking, hearing others speak, and inventing new
words (which must not be done too often). Put your long
words last; but begin a sentence if you can with a long
syllable, and do not keep too many short ones, or too many
monosyllables, together; avoid archaisms; and attend to such
minute, but in at least some cases arbitrary, rules as the
following<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c008'><sup>[441]</sup></a>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let your construction be more frequently round than flat;
let it not gape with too frequent collision of vowels, especially
long ones; nor be rough with the conflict of two consonants;
let not many monosyllables be joined together; let there be no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>great stretch of short syllables nor many long ones; let not the
first syllable of a word be the same as the last of the word
before, nor let the two together make any awkward compound;
let not the oration be deformed by many thin<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c008'><sup>[442]</sup></a> words or vast
syllables; and let not many genitive plurals come together.”<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c008'><sup>[443]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Cautions, it will be observed, sometimes judicious, sometimes
capricious, but never reasoned.</p>

<p class='c001'>The commentary of Marius Victorinus on Cicero’s <cite>Rhetoric</cite>
is the longest of all these treatises. It contains a great deal of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Marius Victorinus on Cicero.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
matter, and there is no discoverable reason why it
should not have contained a great deal more. For
the very first note on Cicero’s words, “I have
thought to myself of this often and very much,” is as follows:
“If there be only one of these, it does not indicate a sufficiently
lengthy cogitation. For we may frequently think of a thing,
but immediately desist from the thinking. We may also think
long upon a thing, but do it only on a single day. He therefore
has properly joined the two, and said: ‘<em>Often</em> and much
have I thought to myself on this.’ And because a thing ought
not to be published unless it be certain and the result of
deliberation, he rightly says: ‘I thought of this <em>to myself</em>.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>All this is exceedingly true; but it is also exceedingly
trivial. And the second is like unto it. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Bonine an mali plus
attulerit hominibus et civitatibus sc. eloquentia</i></span>: “The cause of
his deliberation is not whether eloquence be good or bad, but
whether it have more of good or of bad in it. The order of the
words, however, is not unimportant, for he might have said, ‘of
bad or of good.’ But Cicero stuck to the nature of eloquence,
which, when it first began, did good to men, for it brought them
together. But later, when it was depraved by the ingenuity of
bad men, it hurt the republic very much. So he arranged the
words in the proper order in saying <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Bonine</i></span>, &amp;c. The republic
consists of two parts, private and public—that is to say, of men
and states. We may notice this also in the Verrines, how
Cicero always defends either men or cities.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>A man who is content to write like this need never stop while
paper, pen, and ink hold out, or till the kindness of nature, or
the impatience of men, puts an end to his life. Sometimes the
comment is not quite so nugatory, especially when Victorinus
illustrates the differences between Cicero and Hermagoras.
But he seldom even approaches literary criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rest, save one, may be almost silence. The ambitiously
entitled <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Institutiones Oratoriæ</cite></span> of Sulpicius Victor is incomplete.
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Others.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
What we have of it follows the usual order of “states”
narration, &amp;c., with some, but only a few, peculiarities.
Most of the other articles are both meagre and late.
Emporius deals with <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ethop&oelig;ia</i></span>, the Commonplace, and one or
two other matters. There is a Latin version of the <cite>Progymnasmata</cite>
of Hermogenes. The probably spurious <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Principia
Rhetorices</cite></span>, attributed to St Augustine, are at least commended
by his name, yet hardly by anything else; and the same may be
said in lesser degree of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Compendium</cite></span> of Cassiodorus.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c008'><sup>[444]</sup></a> The
verses of Rufinus, on the rhythms suitable to oratory, have more
interest. And so we may come to Martianus.</p>

<p class='c001'>Inferior as Latin criticism, on the Rhetorical side, is in comparison
with Greek, it is not fanciful to say that it ends with a
better note, though a quaint and fantastic one. The later
stages in Greek, as we have seen, were mere arid technicalities
or idle epideictic—ghosts of things no longer alive, and never
perhaps alive with the best kind of life. What followed in the
Byzantine age had at best the character of literary research.
Such a book as that of Photius, invaluable as it is to us, has no
life-promise in it, either as regards its own generation or for the
future.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the contrary, there is much of both, as we look back on
it, in the eccentric treatise on the <cite>Marriage of Philology and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Martianus Capella.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Mercury</cite>, by Martianus Capella.<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c008'><sup>[445]</sup></a> Of the author and
date of the book we know, with accuracy, hardly
anything at all. His full name appears to have been Martianus
Minneius Felix Capella, and he is described as a Carthaginian.
His date is much contested, as well as his religion, his occupations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>and other things which no mortal need trouble himself
about; while this date, which <em>is</em> of some importance, cannot be
adjusted very exactly. There is, however, not very much
dispute that it must have been somewhere in the fifth century.
“Before 439” is all that his latest editor, Eyssenhardt, will
say.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is certain is that the treatise is written in a very late
and not a little barbarous Latin style, and that it was popular
in the Middle Ages, with that peculiar popularity which seems
to have settled itself upon Boethius, Orosius, and other writers
of the last age before chaos—the age to which those who kept
up education in chaos itself would be most likely to look back,
as connecting them with the greater past yet not too far off.</p>

<p class='c001'>Further, while we find in Martianus a firm outline of the
exact scheme of Humaner Letters which prevailed from 500 to
1500, we find in his frame and setting, slightly preposterous and
more than slightly fantastic as it is, just that touch of romance—of
youth, with its promise as well as its foolishness—which is
wanting in Byzantine work, and which has Future in it. On
both these characteristics of the whole book we must say
something, before coming to its rhetorical part.</p>

<p class='c001'>The title of the book (to observe Servian formality) has been
already given. Its form is that of the Varronian <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>satura</i></span>, or
mingle-mangle of prose and verse; and it is divided into nine
books. The first two of these serve as an introduction, containing
a wonderful rigmarole, in more wonderful jargon,<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c008'><sup>[446]</sup></a> about
things in general, divine and human, the old mythology and
physics, with abstract philosophical personifications, <i>Sophia</i>,
<i>Phronesis</i>, and so forth, coming in. At last it settles down to
the real plan of the treatise, which is that the Seven Liberal
Arts, as adopted (very mainly from this book) by the Middle
Ages, being estated as bridesmaids (or something like it) to
Philology, each Art has a book to herself, and, in the flowery
fantastic fashion of the Introduction, gives a summary of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>teaching to the assembled gods. This summary is of the most
precise and business-like character, despite its “trimmings,” so
that Grammar is not ashamed to inform the gods that “Ulcus
makes ulc<i>e</i>ris, but pecus pec<i>o</i>ris,” and Logic rattles off things
like <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Primæ formæ primus modus est in quo conficitur ex duobus
universalibus</i></span>, and so forth, after a fashion which suggests that
the marriage itself might have been celebrated by Dean Aldrich
with great propriety. The beginnings and ends of the books
are generally decorated with verse, and with fancy <i>prosopop&oelig;iæ</i>
of different kinds: but the stuff of the text is exactly what it
was intended to be—solid schoolbook matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The book devoted to Rhetoric is the fifth, being preceded by
those of Grammar and Logic, in the usual and indeed natural
order of the Trivium:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<i>Gram.</i> loquitur, <i>Dia.</i> vera docet, <i>Rhet.</i> verba colorat,”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>though Martianus does not arrange the Quadrivium exactly
according to the second line of the mnemonic—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<i>Mus.</i> canit, <i>Ar.</i> numerat, <i>Geo.</i> ponderat, <i>Ast.</i> colit Astra,”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>his order being Geometry, or rather Geography, Arithmetic,
Astronomy, Music.</p>

<p class='c001'>The book on Rhetoric opens literally with a flourish of
trumpets,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Interea sonuere tubæ,”</span>—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>which, as some sixteen rather bombastic hexameters full of
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gradus</i></span>-tags inform us, quite alarms the gods, major and minor.
In the midst of it there steps forth “a stately woman of lofty
stature, and confidence greater than common, but radiantly
handsome, helmed and crowned, weaponed both for defence
and with flashing arms wherewith she could smite her enemies
with a thundering coruscation. Under her armpits, and thrown
over her shoulder in Latian fashion, was a vest, exhibiting
embroidery of all possible <em>figures</em> in varied hue, while her
breast was baldricked with gems of the most exquisite colour.
As she walked her arms clashed, so that you would have
thought the broken levin to rattle—with explosive handclaps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>like the collision of clouds, so that you might even believe her
capable of wielding the thunderbolts of Jove. For she it is
who, like a mighty queen of all things, can direct them whither
she will and call them back whence she chooses, and unbend
men to tears or incite them to rage, and sway the minds of
civic crowds as of warring armies. She brought beneath her
sway the senate, the rostra, the courts at Rome,” &amp;c., &amp;c., the
innocent and transparent allegory of the earlier part changing
into a half-historical, half-philosophical account of the functions
of Rhetoric generally. She is followed by a great crowd of
men, some Greek, some Roman, among whom (it is worth
mentioning, as a proof of the taste of the age) Æschines,
Isocrates, and Lysias are specially mentioned for the one
tongue, and, with some uncertain names, Pliny and Fronto
in the other. Cicero is later put, by Rhetoric herself, as beyond
competition in either. She displays her declamatory skill in a
formal exordium, and then plunges into the usual matter of
Rhetorical treatises. The treatment is technical, but by no
means ill-arranged, clear enough even in the bewildering labyrinths
of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>status</i></span>, not excessive in the Figures, and altogether
one of the best of the Latin <cite>Rhetorics</cite>. When she finishes,
Mercury beckons to her to join the group of those who had
played their part, and to salute the bride. So she walks with
much confidence up to Philology, gives her “a sounding kiss—for
she can do nothing silently even if she would—on the top
of her head,”<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c008'><sup>[447]</sup></a> and joins the society of her sisters.</p>

<p class='c001'>Recurring to the speech of one of these sisters, Grammar, and
combining it with this, we shall have no ill notion of the helps
to literary criticism with which the next thousand years of the
world’s history were provided in the west of Europe. They
were rudimentary enough, and those who were furnished with
them had in most cases no thought—indeed for long centuries
hardly any opportunity—of using them for any critical purpose.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>But they lay ready for the hand of others, and at the
Renaissance, as well as in one brilliant and some minor instances
earlier, they were turned with only a little delay to their
proper purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>Grammar, with the quaintness that suffuses the whole book,
says, “My parts are four—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>litteræ</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>litteratura</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>litteratus</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>litterate</i></span>.
‘Letters’ are what I teach; ‘Literature’ am I who teach them;
‘the man of letters’ is he whom I shall have taught; ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>literate</i></span>’
the manner in which my pupil shall skilfully handle things.”
But the expectation thus raised is a little falsified, for “letters”
are taken at their own foot, though Pallas pulls up Grammar
and maintains that she has omitted the “historic part,” which
does not mean our historic in the very least, any more than
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>litteratura</i></span> means our Literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, however, both in these places and throughout the
book, a great deal of “fine confused feeding,” both on matters
really literary and on those more or less subsidiary to literature,
from Phonetics upwards. The citations, though not extremely
frequent or copious, show pretty wide reading, especially
in Latin. In the book on Rhetoric we find very particular and
minute attention paid to these considerations of euphony to
which attention has already been drawn, Martianus (who,
whether we allow him poetry or not, was evidently a very careful
and deft versifier<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c008'><sup>[448]</sup></a>) applying his practice in the other
harmony with his usual quaint conceit here. Nowhere, perhaps,
do we better perceive, though nowhere may we find it
more difficult exactly to follow, the niceties of the ancient ear,
than in the caution that while it is well to end a clause with a
molossus (three longs), if the final word is a trisyllable you must
be careful to put a trochee before it, and by no means a spondee
or pyrrhic. Thus <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Littus ejectis,”</span> with which Tully finishes
a clause, is all right, but <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“rupes ejectis”</span> would be <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pessima
clausula</i></span>, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“apex ejectis”</span> (where <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>apex</i></span> is described as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>pyrrhic, according to its natural quantity in the oblique cases)
almost worse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Further than this, however, Low Latin was not encouraged
by its tutor Martianus to advance. Nor is it surprising that
with such teaching we find no such advance in the first lisping
of the modern literatures themselves, till the strangely articulate
speech of their greatest critic, as he was their greatest creator—Dante
the Wingbearer.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>
  <h4 id='chi.2' class='c024'>INTERCHAPTER II.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In considering and summing up the contribution of ancient
Latin literature to the history and achievements of Criticism,
we may conveniently adopt a threefold division and arrangement,
so as to see, first, what was the general character of Latin
criticism as contrasted with Greek, and with that comparative
study of literature which has only recently become possible;
secondly, its actual and positive achievement; thirdly, the state
in which it left the chances of the future.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first point under the first head is obvious at once, and has
been repeatedly glanced at and referred to already. The Romans
had what the Greeks had not and could not have—the advantage
of literary comparison in two tongues. This—it may be
said a thousand times over, and not be said too often—is an
advantage so enormous that nothing else is required to show the
wonderful faculty of the nation which could effect so much
without it. Without comparison, not merely is the diagnosis of
qualities mostly guesswork, but even the discovery of them becomes
extremely difficult. With comparison, the qualities almost
“leap to the eyes,” and the difference of their results goes far
to help in the differentiation of their natures.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time, this advantage, huge as it still was, was
conditioned and hampered by the fact that Latin, as a language,
was an extremely close connection of Greek, and, as a
literature, was daughter and pupil in one. It would be stepping
out of the safe and solid, if not often trodden, path which
has been prescribed for this book, to inquire whether, if more
scope had been given to the Italian and less to the Italiote<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c008'><sup>[449]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>element, this need have been the case; it is sufficient for our
strictly historical inquiry that it was the case as a matter
of fact. With rare exceptions, of which the Satire itself is a
doubtful chief, with few and more doubtful followers, the
Romans invented no form of literature whatsoever. Nor did
they, as more literary races have so often done, re-create and
make their own the forms that they borrowed. The earlier lost
Roman tragedy was, it is clear, simply <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>calqué</i></span> upon Greek, as
was the Roman comedy (though the mother-wit of Plautus,
one of the most original of Latin writers not of the decadence,
gives it an original air) absolutely <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>calqué</i></span> upon the later forms
of the Attic. The Epic was even more slavishly imitative—those
who rate Virgil highest must admit that, delicately as he
walks, and elegant as is his footgear, he simply steps in the footprints,
now of Homer, now of Apollonius, now, in all probability,
of writers who happen to be lost. The Latin Lyric poets dare
invent no fresh scheme; the historians, even those of genius,
have the fear, or at any rate the following, of the Greeks always
before them. And so they deprive themselves, from the critical
point of view, of the very advantage with which they start—they
lose their chance of finding out the real forms of literature,
transcending those of any particular tongue, by assimilating
the forms of their own as exactly as possible to another’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>And this lack of independence continues to betray itself
throughout, and at once to lessen their opportunities for
criticism, and dilute the quality of such criticism as they do
venture upon. The Roman—it has been observed, and truly
observed, a thousand times—is a man of letters almost always
by accident, and on the way to being something else. When
he is not, he is generally of the second class. Virgil, Horace,
and Cicero perhaps are the chief exceptions, and the two first
at any rate, if not the third, were among the most artificial, if
also of the most artful, imitators of the Greeks. To Catullus,
his exquisite and hardly surpassed poetical faculty was evidently
little more than a toy or a pastime—helpful to express
his moods of love or of laughter, and that was all. So the
magnificent singing robes of Lucretius cover a man who has
hardly a thought of being a poet, who aims mainly at being a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>philosopher; and the scarcely inferior Muse of Juvenal positively
turns her back on her sisters, and busies herself with
a sardonic “criticism of life,” in which indignant disdain is
oddly blended with a strange interest in all trifles, and all
serious things, that are <em>not</em> literary. The men with whom
literature is, if not exactly a passion, a really serious interest,
are, on the other hand, “polyhistoric” persons of talent, in
strengths varying from Cicero himself to Pliny, or else men
like Martial, admirable practitioners, and something more, in
a limited and not very high kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, again, though the Roman talent was extremely businesslike,
it was by no means subtle. It could, at any rate to some
extent, borrow the fanciful Greek refinements; but it found a
necessity of changing them into hard and fast rules.</p>

<p class='c001'>To all this we must add another thing of the first importance.
Great as were the accidental advantages of oratory in Greece,
they were almost greater at Rome. During every age of the
Republic a good speaker had a great weight in his favour; but
in its last age, unless the luck was strangely against him,
honours and wealth were to be had by him simply for the
asking. Under the Empire his position as to the honours of
the state was a little more precarious, and his talents (if he
was a very honest man and not a very discreet one) were not
unlikely to bring him into trouble. But if he were not too
scrupulous—as in the case of Eprius Marcellus, of that Regulus
whom Pliny evidently admired almost as much as he loathed
him, of Fabricius Veiento, and others—these talents could be
dishonestly made subservient to fortune. Even in the worst
times of the worst emperors their exercise in the law courts
was fairly safe, and extremely profitable; while the rage for
declamations also gave the art of speaking a factitious but very
great popularity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hence there was no fear, or hope, of Oratory being brought to
its proper place among the departments of literature. On the
contrary, the practical prosaic character of the people tended
to exalt it higher than ever over such kickshaws as poetry.
Probably nine out of ten Romans would have agreed with Aper
in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Dialogus</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>All this was not particularly favourable to any practice
of criticism, and particularly unfavourable to a fresher and
wider interpretation of it. Yet, as we have seen, there was
something of a set towards literary criticism of a kind in
Rome. There, fashion was at once very powerful and very
conservative: and the fashion of literary conversations, especially
after dinner, set by the Scipios and others when they
came into contact on their foreign campaigns with lettered
Greeks, seems never to have died out till the very incoming of
the Dark Ages, if then. It may have been—it was—more
philological, antiquarian, “folklorish,” and what not, than
strictly literary, but it was sometimes this. The other fashion
of recitation and declamation, closely connected with this, provided
also material for it. Sometimes, no doubt, these literary
conversations were a terrible bore, as the satirists not obscurely
tell us, and as Pliny, in a letter<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c008'><sup>[450]</sup></a> full of good sense and pleasantness,
points out to a friend of his who had been bored at another
kind of dinner, where the fun was provided by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>scurræ</i></span>,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>moriones</i></span>, and other professional persons not to be mentioned
in English.</p>

<p class='c001'>From all this we find, and are not surprised to find, that
literary critical talk, and literary critical writing, in Rome,
turned much more upon oratory than upon any other department,
and that, when they did turn on others, these were often
merely or mainly regarded as storehouses of quotation and
patterns of imitation for the orator. There was, indeed, one
additional reason for this which has not yet been mentioned,
but which was not unnaturally among the most powerful of
all. Oratory was about the only division of literature in which
even a very patriotic Roman could, with any show of reason,
consider his countrymen the equals of the Greeks. Here the
flattering unction was often laid; and though as regards Cicero
and Demosthenes, the inevitably selected champions, we may
hardly think the match an equal one, it must be remembered
that the extraordinary, and not quite comprehensible, loss of
nearly all other Roman orators puts Latin at a very great disadvantage.
We have Æschines, Lysias, Isæus, something, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>not much, of Hyperides, a good deal of Isocrates, on the literary
side of oratory. But we have nothing by which fairly to judge
Hortensius or Catulus, Calvus or Pollio or Messala. What is
certain is that men of cool judgment, who did not venture to
set up even Virgil against Homer, and who practically let all
Roman minor poetry go by the board, did think they could
make a fight for Rome in symbouleutic and dikanic, if not in
epideictic, oratory.</p>

<p class='c001'>It follows from all these things that, strong as is the oratorical
preoccupation in Greek, it is stronger still in Roman Rhetoric
and criticism. Even the men who take the widest view of
literature, and are most familiar with it—Cicero, Pliny, nay,
Quintilian himself—fall, as has been said, unconsciously, or in
the way of bland assumption as of a matter not worth arguing
about, into the habit of regarding it either primarily as an exercising-ground,
a magazine, a source of supply and training for
the orator, or as a means of sport and pastime to him in the
intervals of his more serious business. The utterly preposterous
notion (as it seems to us) of trying a poet like Virgil
by the rules of the rhetorician, classifying his speeches, pointing
out his deft use of “means of persuasion,” laying stress on the
proprieties and felicities of his use of language according to
the rhetorical laws, taking examples of Figures from him and
the like, could arise from nothing but this preliminary assumption
or confusion, and could only be excused by it. It is in
fact all-pervading—forget or lose sight of it, and there is hardly
a Roman utterance about literature which will not be either
quite unmeaning, or very seriously misleading.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequence is that very seldom do we get literary
criticism of anything like the best kind—of any kind that
deserves the name in meaning at once full and strict—from a
Roman. There is no Latin Longinus—Quintilian himself is
but at best a rather less technical Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
and it is even very uncertain whether he does not owe a good
deal directly to Dionysius himself. At any rate, much as we owe
him, we owe it rather to his ineradicable and inevitable good
sense, his thorough grasp of the educational values of things,
and his unfeigned love of literature, than to any full conception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>on his part of the art of criticism as an art of appreciation—as
a reasoned valuing and analysing of the sources of literary
charm.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another consequence (of the illustrative kind chiefly) is that
the spell of the Figures is even more heavy on the Roman than
on the Greek. That horrified cry<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c008'><sup>[451]</sup></a> of the unlucky Albucius,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>schemata tollis ex rerum natura</i></span>, is as much the note of the
average Roman critic as the quotation given above from
Simylus<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c008'><sup>[452]</sup></a> is above the note both of Roman and even of Greek
as a rule. It could hardly out of the head of a critic of
this stamp, that if you took the proper number of scruples of
hyperbole, so many drams of antiphrasis, and so on, you would
make a fine sentence—that so many sentences thus formed and
arranged, with proper regard to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inventio</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>narratio</i></span>, and the rest,
would make a fine chapter, so many chapters a fine book. The
whole process, once more, is topsy-turvy, and can come to no
good end.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Poetic of the limited kind we have, of course, from Rome
one document, the historical importance of which it is impossible
to exaggerate. But the intrinsic importance, even of this,
is singularly out of proportion to its reputation and its influence.
As has been explained in detail above, it may be unjust
to regard the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epistola ad Pisones</cite></span> as a designed and complete
tract <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Arte Poetica</cite></span>. But make as much allowance as we may
and can for scheme and purpose, the intrinsic quality of such
criticism as it does give will remain clear and unaltered.
Neither of the real nature, requirements, capabilities of any one
literary form, nor of the character of any one source of literary
beauty, does Horace show himself in the very least degree
conscious. His precepts are now precepts of excellent commonsense,
not less—perhaps rather more—applicable to life than to
literature: now purely arbitrary rules derived from the practice—sometimes
the quite accidental practice—of great preceding
writers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, all the same, Horace unconsciously and almost indirectly
does take up a very decided critical side, and expresses, with the
neatness and in the rememberable fashion to be expected from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>so consummate a master, one of the two great critical creeds.
Nor is there any doubt that this creed, so far as literary criticism
appealed to the Roman mind at all, was that of by far the
larger number of persons. This is—not necessarily in a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ne
varietur</i></span> shape, but put very clearly in a certain form—the
creed of what is known as “Classicism,” the creed which
recommends, first of all, as the probable, if not the certain, road
to literary success, adherence to the approved traditions, the
elaboration of types and generalisations rather than indulgence
in the eccentric and efforts to create the individual, the preference
of the regular to the vague, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, it may be repeated without much rashness, was even
more the critical orthodoxy of Rome than it was the critical
orthodoxy of Greece. We see it in the stock preference of the
Attic to the Asiatic style in oratory; it simply defrays the
whole of the just-mentioned criticism of Horace; it animates
the campaign of the satirists against archaic and euphuist
phraseology; it is clearly the proper thing to think in the
literary miscellanies of Gellius, and even of Macrobius. The
precepts of the formal treatises, so far as they touch on style at
all, never fail to express this general tendency; and the even
more deliberate and canonical “correctness” of the modern
Latin races and literatures, if not directly and unavoidably
inherited, is a very legitimate attempt to recover and improve
the lost heritage of their ancestor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor will any other conclusion, I think, be drawn from the
study of those grammarians in the strict sense, of whom little
or nothing has been said in the main body of this Book, for the
simple reason that there was little or nothing to say. From
Varro to Festus the symptoms which we have noted elsewhere
recur with unmistakable fidelity. The etymology and signification
of words; the explanation of customs, rites, myths; the
arrangements of accidence and syntax—all these things awake
evident interest, and receive careful and often most intelligent
pains. These grammarians (and, of course, still more professedly
metrical writers like Terentianus Maurus) are diligent
on metre, and even behind metre, on that most difficult of
subjects, in all times and languages, the metrical quality and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>quantity as distinguished from the metrical arrangement of
words. But where all these things begin to group and
crystallise themselves into higher criticism of literary form and
charm, there our authors, I think it will be found with hardly
an exception, stop dead. I shall be surprised (to stick to the
example formerly given) to have pointed out to me a single
passage in which the <em>poetical</em> quality of the Ennian, the
Lucretian, and the Virgilian hexameter is discussed.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time, it would be uncritical not to perceive, and
unhistorical not to note, the existence in the history of Latin
literature of a current running strongly in the opposite direction,
making itself distinctly felt at more than one period, and,
finally, in creative literature at least, going near to triumph.
We have seen, both directly and indirectly, that in the first
century of our era there <em>was</em> a very strong set towards archaism
and euphuism, that it had the patronage of Seneca the father,
certainly, if not also that of his more famous and more influential
son; that it was not by any means wholly disapproved by
Pliny; and that though what we may call literary orthodoxy was
against it, a very large bulk (perhaps the great majority) of the
prose declamations and the verse exercises of the time must have
exhibited its influence. What is more, it is certain that in more
than one of the Roman colonial or provincial districts, which
furnished fresher and more vigorous blood than the Eternal City
herself, or her Italian precinct, could now supply, this tendency
received very strong accessions from various local peculiarities.
It seems to have been least prevalent in Gaul, though by no
means unknown there; the Senecas, and Quintilian himself,
show at what an early date Spanish blood or birth inclined
those who had it to what was long afterwards to take names
from Guevara and Gongora. But the great home of Roman
Euphuism was Africa. To say nothing of ecclesiastical writers
like Tertullian (who might be supposed to have their style
affected by Eastern influences), Apuleius earlier, and Martianus
later, are more than sufficient, and luckily pretty fully extant,
witnesses to the fact.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet this tendency is not represented in criticism at all.
Apuleius, who was a very pretty pleader as well as an accomplished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>Euphuist in original composition, might well have left
us a parallel to De Quincey’s own vindications of the ornate
style, if he had chosen; but it did not apparently occur to him
though the <i>Florida</i> would have given a quite convenient and
proper home to such a dissertation.<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c008'><sup>[453]</sup></a> <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Con amore</i></span> as Martianus
describes (in the passage above translated) the gorgeousness
of Rhetoric, it is strictly in reference to her <em>oratorical</em> practice.
If the satires of the later Cæsars’ time take the other side,
and so do give us some criticism on that, it is pretty certainly
because all the greatest satirists, from Aristophanes
downwards, have always been Tories, and have selected the
absurdities of innovation more gladly than those of tradition
for their target. Nay, it is a question whether Petronius, in
one direction, and Persius in another, do not, so far as their
own compositions are concerned, somewhat incur the blame of
which they are so lavish, though Martial and Juvenal certainly
do not. On all sides the conviction comes in that for strictly
literary criticism the time was not ripe, or that the country,
the nation, was indisposed and unprepared for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>In no point, perhaps, is this so noteworthy and so surprising
as in regard to what we may call the literary criticism of
metre. For this Latin offered, at both ends of the history
of Latin proper, temptations and opportunities which, so far as
we know, were unknown to the Greeks. At the one end there
were the remains, scanty, but significant even now, then probably
abundant, of “Saturnian” prosody. Of this, of course,
Roman writers, technical and other, do take notice: they even,
with the antiquarian and mythological patriotism so common at
Rome, take a fairly lively interest in it. But of the remarkable
<em>literary</em> difference between it and the accepted literary metres—a
point almost exactly on a par with that of the difference between
our ballad metre and the accepted literary poetic forms
of the eighteenth century—they do not, so far as I remember,
seem to have taken any notice at all. There must have been—in
fact we know perfectly well that there were—Roman literary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>antiquaries as diligent, as enthusiastic, and, no doubt, at least as
intelligent as any of our own, from Percy and Hurd to Tyrwhitt
and Ritson. There is no reason in the nature of things
(indeed, Varro is a very fair analogue to the historian of English
poetry) why there should not have been Romans of the calibre
at least of Warton, if not even of Gray. But hardly a vestige
of the combined antiquarian, philological, and literary interest,
which animates all these men of ours, appears in the extant
fragments of any Roman writer.</p>

<p class='c001'>The facts at the other end point to the same conclusion.
From no Roman critic, so far as I know, have we any notice
whatsoever of that insurrection or resurrection (whichever word
may be preferred) of accentual against quantitative rhythm
which is one of the most interesting, and certainly one of the
most mysterious, phenomena of the literary history of the
world. Grant that early in the third century (if that be the
right date) no cultivated student was likely to pay much attention
to the barbarous rhythms of a Commodian,<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c008'><sup>[454]</sup></a> to be prepared
even to consider</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Audite quoniam propheta de illo prædixit”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>as a hexameter. But a hundred and fifty years later things
were different. Before Macrobius wrote, before Servius commented,
the verse of Prudentius had been given to the world.
Now, the mere classical scholar has no doubt been usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>unkind to Prudentius,<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c008'><sup>[455]</sup></a> but few people who have read him without
a fixed idea that anybody who writes in Latin is bound
to confirm to the prosody of the Augustan age, can have read
him without frequent satisfaction. At any rate, he is a literary
<em>person</em>; and his personality is emphasised by the fact that at
one time he tries to write, and not infrequently succeeds in writing,
very fair orthodox hexameters and trimeters; at others
(and in the best work of the <cite>Cathemerinon</cite> and <cite>Peristephanon</cite>)
his verse, whether answering to the test of the finger or not
in metre, is clearly accentual in rhythm, and seems to be
yearning for rhyme to complete and dress it. Now, if literary
criticism in the full sense had been common, such a phenomenon
must have attracted attention. The orthodox critics would have
attacked it as furiously as the orthodox critics in England
attacked Coleridge’s system of metrical equivalence, or the
orthodox critics in France attacked Victor Hugo’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>enjambements</i></span>.
The unorthodox critics, the revolutionary and romantic party,
would, as in each case, have welcomed it with pæans. But, so
far as we know, not the slightest notice was taken of Prudentius
by the literary wits of the <cite>Saturnalia</cite>, or by any one else.</p>

<p class='c001'>In part, no doubt, this silence may be set down to accidental
and extra-literary causes. The very growth of provincial
literatures would at once have rendered the productions of these
literatures less likely to reach Rome, and have disinclined the
literary critics of the capital to listen to provincial productions.
Even the debate of Christian and Pagan,<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c008'><sup>[456]</sup></a> as it became more and
more of a conflict between triumphant youth and declining
eld, less and less of the resurrection of a desperate and despised
minority against established order, may have had something to
do with the matter. But, however this may be, the facts are
the facts.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>We shall do well to accept them as they are, and to recognise
that Latin had the criticism which it deserved, the criticism
which was made necessary by the conditions of its own classical
literature, and, lastly, the criticism which was really most
useful both for itself and for its posterity—that is to say, in
greater or less degree, not merely the so-called Romance
tongues, but all the literary languages of modern Europe. The
first two points must be tolerably clear to any tolerable Latinist,
but they may be freshly put. A literature like classical Latin,
which is from first to last <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in statu pupillari</i></span>, which, with whatever
strength, deftness, elegance, even originality at times,
follows in the footsteps of another literature, must for the very
life of it have a critical creed of order, discipline, moderation.
Otherwise it runs the risk of being a mere hybrid, even a mere
monstrosity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still more certainly, nothing could have been better for the
future of the world than the exact legacy which Latin left, not
merely in its great examples of literature, but in the forms of
the scholastic Grammar and Rhetoric, to that millennium of
reconstruction and recreation which is called the Middle Age.
For that wonderful period—which even yet has never been put
in its right place in the history of the world—a higher lesson
would have been thrown away, or positively injurious. No instruction
in Romanticism was wanted by the ages of Romance:
for full literary knowledge of the ancient literatures they were
in no wise suited or prepared. Their business was, after a
long period of mere foundation-work in the elaboration of the
modern speeches, to get together the materials of the modern
literatures, and to build up the structure of these as well as they
could. So strongly did they feel the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nisus</i></span> towards this, that
they even travestied into their own likeness such of the old
literature as remained.</p>

<p class='c001'>But still Grammar and Rhetoric abode—to be a perpetual
grounding and tutelage, a “fool-guard” and guide-post in these
ages of exploration and childhood. That the Rhetoric was
meagre and arbitrary, that a great deal of it had nothing to do
with literature at all, but was a sort of fossilised skeleton of a
bygone philosophy, or else a mere business training, mattered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>nothing. The Trivium and Quadrivium, the legacies of the
classics, especially of Latin, gave in every one of their divisions,
and not least in Rhetoric, precisely the formal stays, the fixed
norms and forms of method, which were required in the general
welter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had the appreciative criticism of Latin been stronger and
wider, had it left any tradition in its own last age, and so been
able to throw that tradition as a bridge over the dark time to
come, it would have been no advantage, but a loss and a
mischief. Not only would it have been waste of time for the
Middle Ages to appreciate Greek and Latin literature critically,
if they could have done so, but it would have hampered them
in the doing of their own great day’s, or rather night’s, work—their
work of assimilation, of recuperation, and, not least, of
dream.</p>

must own that a certain compunction

with the shortcomings of ancient critics,
when I find in this edition, at the end
of the nineteenth century, great care
about the text, but not a single word
about the date, the person, or the circumstances
of Commodianus, and an
utter ignoring of the literary position
and interest of the matter edited. Commodian’s
form may be barbarous, and
his matter may be respectably ordinary;
but he is, at any rate, on a not
yet disturbed hypothesis, the ancestor—or
the earliest example—of the
prosody of every modern language
which combines (as some at least of us
hold that all modern languages do)
quantitative scansion with a partly or
wholly non-quantitative syllabic value.

<p class='c007'>It may seem a platitude, but it really has much more of the
altitudinous than of the platitudinous about it, to say that,
before entering on the consideration of mediæval criticism,<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c008'><sup>[457]</sup></a>
it is above all things necessary to clear the mind of cant about
mediæval literature. For in no division of this work is such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>caution a more appropriate writing on the door. On the classical
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Characteristics of mediæval literature.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and on the modern sections it would be a
gratuitous impertinence. In both or them, as here,
there is the distinction between linguistic and literary
criticism, and the further distinction between
literary criticism of different kinds. But in both there are, as
there always have been in relation to the classics, and as there
sometimes have been in relation to modern literature, a very
large number of persons who are aware of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>crevasses</i></span>, and
who can cross them.</p>

<p class='c001'>In mediæval literature such persons are, and for the strongest
reasons, much more to seek. Until recently—it is the greatest
“refusal” and the greatest misfortune in the literary history of
the world—mediæval literature, which some, at least, believe to
hold the keys of both ancient and modern, was utterly neglected
and contemned. Then, for a time, it was praised without full
knowledge, or by divination only. It is now possible to know
much if not most of it; but few are they who are content to
know it as literature. Not only has it had to go through,
all at once, the usual diseases to which literary childhood is
obnoxious, the petty grammarianisms which Latin and Greek
got over in their own time, the squabbles as to interpretation
from which the Renaissance, to a great extent, delivered us in
their case, and the criticastry of the seventeenth-eighteenth
centuries, but new ailments, diphtherias and influenzas of its
own, have arisen in “phonology,” and Heaven knows what else.
Even this does not exhaust the list of ills that wait upon its
most unhappy state. It has been thought necessary, for political
and ecclesiastical reasons, to praise the Middle Ages a little
unwisely for a time, and then (more recently) to abuse them
with an unwisdom so much greater, that one feels inclined to
relapse upon the mood of the real Mr Kenelm Digby of <cite>The Broad
Stone of Honour</cite>, and the imaginary Mr Chainmail of <cite>Crotchet
Castle</cite>. Abused and extolled as “Ages of Faith,” they were
really ages of a mixture of logical argument and playful half-scepticism.
Regarded with scorn as “Ages of Ignorance,” they
knew what they did know thoroughly, which is more than can
be said of some others. Commiserated as Ages of Misery, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>were probably the happiest times of the world, putting Arcadia
and Fairyland out of sight. Patronised as Ages of mere preparation,
they accomplished things that we have toiled after
in vain for some five hundred years. They have in the rarest
cases been really understood, even historically. And the
understanding which has, in these rare cases, reached their
history, has almost always merely scrabbled on the doors of
their literature. There are exceptions, of course, some of whom
have taught me all I know, and whom I honour only short of
the great originals. But they are still exceptions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lest any one should accuse me of passing from criticism into
dithyrambic, let me acknowledge at once that whatsoever the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its attitude to criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Middle Ages were or were not, they were certainly
not Ages of Criticism. They could not—it has
already been hinted—have been anything of the kind; it would
have ruined their business and choked their vocation if they
had attempted to be so. One mighty figure does indeed show
himself in their midst, to pass on the torch from Aristotle and
Longinus, through unknowing ages, to Coleridge and Sainte-Beuve.
But their very essence was opposed to criticism in
any prevalence. The incorrigible and triumphant (though or
because wholly unconscious) originality which, in practice,
created the Romance, revolutionised the Drama, altered History,
devised a fresh Lyric, would have been constrained and
paralysed in the face of theory. At no time can we be so
thankful for the shortcomings of the School Rhetoric which, if
it had been better, might have done frightful harm. Had the
Italian critics, with their warpings of Plato and of Aristotle,
appeared in the thirteenth century instead of the sixteenth, it
might have been all over with us. For the thirteenth century
was docile: the sixteenth, fortunately, was not.</p>

<p class='c001'>In one particular, however, the comparatively scanty criticism
of the thousand years from the sack of Rome by Alaric to the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Importance of prosody.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
fall of Constantinople before Mahomet, acquires a
new significance. We have hitherto said little about
the formal criticism of prosody, and for good reasons. The
Greek, and in a less degree the Latin, writers on Metric, are
interesting, but their interest is hardly literary at all, though it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>has so much to do with literature. Before we have any finished
classical literature from them, Greek had by its own <i>euphuia</i>
acquired, and Latin had forced on itself by a stern process of
gymnastic, systems of prosody which, though in the former
case at least easy as nature, were in both cases simply a branch
of mathematics. The decay of Greek, the bursting by the
strong Italian wine of the earthen or leathern vessel of artificial
prosody which had so long contained it, and the rise of the new
vernaculars, introduced a perfectly different situation; and the
criticism, the tentative unscientific rule-of-thumb criticism, of
prosody assumed an importance, at about the beginning of the
fifth century of our era, which it has not lost on the eve of the
twentieth. But these general questions will be further treated
at the close of this Book (see Interchapter iii.) We must now
turn to the details of the actual history.</p>

<p class='c001'>The standard collection<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c008'><sup>[458]</sup></a> of Latin Rhetorics contains four of
very early date, speaking from our present point of view. The
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The early formal Rhetorics—Bede.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
oldest, and, if it were genuine, the most interesting,
of all in point of authorship, that attributed to S.
Augustine, we shall—for reasons—take last. The
others, still of great interest in this respect, are by,
or attributed to, the three greatest men of “regular” letters in
the whole period (500-1000), except Scotus Erigena—to wit,
Bede, Isidore of Seville, and Alcuin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bede, who has also left us work of interest on metre,<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c008'><sup>[459]</sup></a> has
included in his works a tractate on the Tropes and Figures of the
Holy Scriptures which gives us, at least, a glimmer in darkness.
His argument is characteristic of his time; but nobody except
a churl, and an ignorant and foolish churl, will smile at it. The
Figures are the most important things in style; the Scriptures
are the most important of books; therefore there must be as
good Figures in the Scriptures as in any other book, and better.
He uses, to prove his point, seventeen figures with examples.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>In what follows, the chief point of interest is that he first
quotes classical examples (chiefly from Virgil) and then Scriptural
analogues. But he does not by any means confine himself
to the chosen seventeen.</p>

<p class='c001'>The critical importance of this, for its time especially, can
be shown with little labour. The great danger, the great curse,
so to say, of uncritical reading, is the taking of things as a
matter of course, and the neglect to analyse and ascertain the
exact causes and sources of literary excellence. Now, in itself,
the comparison of the Bible and the classics, from the hard-and-fast
point of view of a scholastic classification of Figures, is a
very small matter—and not perhaps even a very good matter.
But when these two so different things are compared, from any
point of view no matter what, the curiosity is aroused; the
mind begins to consider what it really <em>does</em> think fine in this
and that; and in happy circumstances and cases a real—in
any perhaps some approach to a real—appreciation of the goodness
of literature will result. Bede did not intend this—he
might have left no pepper to any one who suggested it to him,
as a consequence of his work. But such a consequence at least
might follow.</p>

<p class='c001'>The references of that great authority of the early Middle
Ages, Isidore of Seville, to Rhetoric are not copious, and are
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Isodore.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
chiefly made up of the already consecrated tags,
while the subject is somewhat mixed with Logic.
The orator is the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vir bonus dicendi peritus</i></span>; the parts of Rhetoric
are as usual, its kinds likewise. The forensic side is almost
exclusively prominent, and style has hardly any attention
at all.<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c008'><sup>[460]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Very much more curious is the dialogue with Charlemagne,
attributed to Alcuin or Albinus. The emperor-king, in a
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Alcuin (?).</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
rather precious but not inelegant style, beseeches
instruction on the point; and his teacher, with
grandiosity suitable (at least on the estimate of Martianus)
to the subject, protests that the spark of his little intellect
can add nothing to the flame-vomiting light of the emperor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>genius,<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c008'><sup>[461]</sup></a> but will obey his commands, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>juxta auctoritatem veterum</i></span>.
In fact, he follows the usual lines, with occasional indulgence
in the curiously, and rather barbarically, but sometimes not
unpleasantly, ornate style which seems to have pleased the
youthful nations of modern Europe. The hard cases of the
old Declamations make a considerable appearance—in fact,
very much more of the dialogue (which is neither very
long nor very short) is devoted to this side of the matter
than is the case with Bede and Isidore; and there is even
a slight glance into the subject of Fallacies. The passage
on Elocution may be scrutinised, not perhaps with very great
results, but with some interest and profit, not merely because
it directly concerns us, but also because one may at
least hope to have the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>auctoritas veterum</i></span> qualified by a little
personal and temporal colour. From attention to style comes
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>venustas</i></span> to the cause, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dignitas</i></span> to the orator. It must
be <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>facunda et aperta</i></span>—that is to say, grammatically correct
and clearly arranged. The best authors must be read, and
their example followed. In choosing single words (here the
characteristic above-mentioned may be thought to appear,
while the sentiment, and even the phrase, though of course
not new, leads us interestingly on to the great work of
Dante) we ought to choose <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>electa et illustria</i></span>. Metaphor
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>translatio</i></span>) brings ornament; as the first object of clothing
is to keep the cold out, and then we make it ornamental,
so, &amp;c. In fact, metaphor is now quite common—the very
vulgar speak of the vines “gemming,” the harvest being
“luxuriant,” the crops “waving”: for what can hardly be
described by a “proper” word is illustrated by a metaphor.
Metaphors make things clearer, as “the sea <em>shivers</em>”; and
sometimes save a periphrasis, as “the dart <em>flies</em> from the
hand.” But you must be careful only to use honest metaphors;
and here the old illustrations recur. Special figures are slightly
touched, though Metonymy and Synecdoche occur. The remarks
on Composition are very meagre, chiefly deprecating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>hiatus, the juxtaposition of similar syllables, &amp;c. It is not
unnoteworthy that much more time is spent on actual delivery,
that no illustrations from the poets appear, and that
the piece finishes with remarks on religious and moral virtue,
of great excellence in themselves, but having very little
to do with Rhetoric, save indirectly in the epideictic kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is unnecessary to hunt further through the formal
Rhetorics which appeared during the Dark and earlier
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Another track of inquiry.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Middle Ages, though it may be proper to return
to the subject in the chapter dealing with
Criticism after Dante. Conservative in all their
ways, though with a conservatism compatible with limitless
expatiation and rehandling, these Ages were nowhere more
conservative than in regard to Rhetoric; and Martianus by
himself almost represents their manual thereof. The influence
of the <cite>Marriage of Philology</cite>, which is prominent at the middle
in the <cite>Contention of Phyllis and Flora</cite>,<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c008'><sup>[462]</sup></a> appears again at the
very close, when Hawes “rang to even-song,” and it will dispense
all but specialists from investigation under this head.
We have seen how small is its contribution to criticism. We
must therefore look elsewhere, and, throwing back a little to
St Augustine, himself a Professor of Rhetoric, may endeavour
to trace and pick up, often in bypaths, such windfalls of expression
about literature as may enable us to compose something
like a history, if not of definite and expressed Criticism,
at any rate of Literary Taste, century by century, from the
fourth to the thirteenth, through a chain of now almost wholly
Christian writers.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable, if not certain, that the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Principia Rhetorices</cite></span>,
which has been already referred to, and which we have
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>St Augustine a Professor of Rhetoric.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
under the name of Aurelius Augustinus, was never
written or delivered by the chief of the Latin
Fathers, at Tagaste or at Carthage, at Milan or
at Rome. The loss to him is certainly not great. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>treatise, which is short (some ten quarto pages in Capperonnier),
is based upon, and apparently to a large extent
quoted or stolen from, Hermagoras, Cicero’s Rhodian
master. It busies itself first with the nature of Rhetoric,
and the calumnies brought against it, and proceeds to
the examination of technicalities, not dictionary-fashion, as
had lately become usual, but continuously. Perhaps the sole
argument (a worthless one enough, for there were probably
ten thousand professors of Rhetoric doing the same thing in
his time) for the Saint’s authorship is, that no book could
better answer to his own bitter description of his worldly
profession as “selling words to boys.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But he <em>was</em> a Professor of Rhetoric, and therefore, in a
way, of literature; and the decisive, because in most cases
unintentional, evidence of the <cite>Confessions</cite><a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c008'><sup>[463]</sup></a> touches
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His attitude to literature before and after his conversion.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
our subject closely and frequently. We can not only
see what was Augustine’s attitude to literature even
before his conversion, but from his attitude to it
after that event we can, without rashness or unfairness,
discern the causes which make one huge and important
division of late ancient and early mediæval literature—the
works of the Fathers of the Church—almost a blank for
our special purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>That Augustine as a little boy (<cite>Conf.</cite>, I. 13) hated Greek
and loved Latin, especially the Latin poets,<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c008'><sup>[464]</sup></a> has nothing in
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Analysis of the</i> Confessions <i>from this point of view</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
it more marvellous than that any healthy English
boy should hate Latin and love (it is to be
hoped that he still does love) <cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite>, and
<cite>Gulliver</cite>, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Morte d’Arthur</cite></span>, and the <cite>Faerie
Queene</cite>. And there is, no doubt, some allowance
to be made for that “megalomania” of repentance which
besets the strongly religious, in his regrets for the tears he
shed over dead Dido, neglectful of his own death in life
as far as the soul was concerned.<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c008'><sup>[465]</sup></a> But his attitude to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>literature, as expressed in this chapter and onwards, is suggestive
not merely of religiosity, but of a certain antiquarian
priggishness. Will not even the “sellers of grammar” confess
that nobody knows when Æneas came to Carthage,
while the more learned know that he never did? Which
is the more useful, reading and writing <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>, or the figments
of poetry? Homer, though full of “sweetly idle
fiction,” was bitter to him, because he was difficult. And
then he returns to the other line, wherein, it must be confessed,
he had strong pagan as well as Christian support.</p>

<p class='c001'>Do not the poets assign vices to the gods, or rather give the
divine title to wicked men? (cap. 16.) Does not Terence
actually make one of his characters shelter his own sin under
Jove’s example? How absurd it was, if not worse, to have to
learn by heart the wrath of Juno at her ill-success in thwarting
Æneas! Nay, he proceeds to further altitudes. Grammar is
more carefully observed than the Law of God. Rhetoric helps
you to do harm to human beings. His own father spent
more money than he could afford on sending him to Madaura
and Carthage for education, but was wholly indifferent to his
spiritual welfare (Book II. cap. iii.) His success in the Rhetoric
school (III. 2) filled him with wicked pride. He even liked
stage plays; was so wretchedly mad as to grieve at their falsehoods
and shadows, and so wicked as to sympathise with the
imaginary but immoral enjoyments of lovers. He read Cicero’s
<cite>Hortensius</cite> with admiration, but for its wisdom, not its form.
His own professorship of Rhetoric was a “covetous selling of
tricks to conquer,” though he himself would not fee a wizard to
gain a dramatic prize. He wrote a treatise, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Apto et Proprio</cite></span>,
which we (like him) have not, but which was evidently, if
criticism at all, criticism in the abstract. Although he refers
often (<i>e.g.</i>, V. 7) to his lectures on literature, he gives us hardly
a notion of his literary preferences, estimates, views; and his
Manichæan difficulties, his agonies about the origin of evil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>seem to have drawn him further and further from anything
but a mere professional connection with the subject. In his
high eulogium of Victorinus (VIII. 2) it can hardly be said that
he says a word about his literature. In all his allusions to his
Chair he constantly refers to the oratorical, or rather the debating
and advocating, not the literary side. And what to me
seems the most conclusive and remarkable point of all, the long
discourse of sinful, or at least worldly, pleasures with which Book
Ten closes, contains not a reference to the pleasures of literature,
which, as we know from the beginning, he did think ungodly.
They have apparently not importance enough to be taken into
consideration, not merely in connection with the pleasures of
sense (where there might be a reason for their omission), but
along with curiosity, love of praise, fear of blame, vainglory,
self-conceit, and other purely intellectual temptations. The
boy had been charmed by Virgil and Terence—wicked charms
he acknowledges—but the man, though he certainly does not
mean to deny their wickedness, has simply put them away as
childish things.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have thought it well to be somewhat particular in regard to
this appearance of what we may call the Puritan attitude to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>A conclusion from this to the general patristic view of literature.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
literature, in its earliest and perhaps almost its
greatest exponent. It is of course not entirely new—nothing
indeed is ever that; and it is not merely
foreshadowed, but to a certain extent fathered, by
the Platonic views of poetry, and the Academic and
Pyrrhonist views of literature generally. But these older
things here acquire an entirely new character and importance—a
character and an importance which can hardly be said to
be merely matters of history yet. Moreover, as I have hinted
above, the attitude is that—varied only by the personal factor—of
all the Fathers, more or less, until, and for some time after,
the complete downfall of Paganism, and of the great majority of
ecclesiastical writers for a thousand years later still.</p>

<p class='c001'>Its justifications, or at least its excuses, have been often put,
and must in great measure be allowed. Not merely had it, as
has been said, a most respectable pedigree in purely Pagan
philosophy, but, as a fighting creed, it was almost indispensable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>to the Church Militant. Literature, and Heathen religion, and
the Seven Deadly Sins, were, it might even seem, inextricably
connected. If you wrote an epic you had to begin with Jove or
some other false god; if you wrote a parcel of epigrams it was
practically <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>de rigueur</i></span> to accuse somebody of unnatural vices, or
affect a partiality for them yourself. But even if things had
been better—if there had been no danger of relapses in faith,
and none of the worst kind in practice—it was inevitable that
the poor Fine Arts should seem vain and trifling exercises to
that intense “otherworldliness” which had come (as no doubt
it will at some time or other have to come again) as an alternative
to secular absorption in things secular. To Augustine,
as to monk and homilist long afterwards, not merely was the
theology of literature false, and its morals detestable, but it was—merely
as occupation—frivolous and puerile, a thing unworthy
not only of a Christian but even of a reasonable being. We
shall have to count with so much of this in the present book
(and not there only) that it seemed worth while to take note of
it at the outset. It probably did no great harm, for, as has
been repeated more than once, what was wanted was a new
development of literature, as fresh and as spontaneous as possible:
and this might have been more hindered than helped by
too great a devotion to the old. Meanwhile the Seven Liberal
Arts were not much interfered with, either by the Seven Deadly
Sins or by their opponent Virtues, and the mere necessities of
preaching and homily-writing, of controversy with heretics, and
of historical summaries, obliged to practise in the more scholastic
branches of literature itself. As for the less scholastic, they
came soon enough, and more than well enough, as the rains
of heaven descended and the wind of the Spirit blew—the
Northern wind.</p>

<p class='c001'>In such a state of mind literary criticism, though the fact is
not even yet universally recognised, is practically impossible.
It is the furthest stage, and to some extent the converse, of the
famous fallacy—stated once by a critic<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c008'><sup>[466]</sup></a> of great though one-sided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>ability, and probably accepted, tacitly or implicitly, by
the majority of critics still—that a man “must take pleasure in
the thing represented before he can take pleasure in the representation.”
Here the assumption is that, if you take pleasure
in the representation, you take pleasure in the thing represented.
And there is more also. Not only are the subjects of literature
in part men or devils masquerading as gods, in part men committing
more or less shameful acts; but, even when they are in
themselves unobjectionable, they are idle fiction, there is no
truth or usefulness in them. Men with immortal souls to be
saved or lost should at the worst be horrified at touching such
pitch, at the best be ashamed of burdening themselves with such
trumpery. Great as is St Augustine’s genius for producing
literature, one doubts whether he had much taste for estimating
it. The story of the famous pears, which he stole, comes
in rather fatally pat. He stole them, he says, not because
he wanted them or liked them, but because it was naughty
to do it. This, though no uncommon mood, is the worst possible
for the critic. It leads him, in the same way, to praise
a book or an author, not because he really likes them, but
because they are naughty—the reverse of the other fallacy
and its punishment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taking this fact into consideration, and adding to it the facts
already glanced at,—the sickness incidental to the moulting of
language, the want of helpfulness in such ancient critics as
were likely to fall in the writer’s way, the increasing scarcity,
for hundreds of years, of books, and other things of the same
kind,—it will be seen to have been not nearly but wholly impossible
that the Dark and the Early Middle Ages could produce
much criticism—or any, strictly speaking. The importance
of what they did produce, with the much greater importance
of the wholly new material they offered (to be long
slighted by the critical world), will be considered at length
in the Interchapter succeeding this Book. In the course of the
Book itself we shall have to consider a few rhetorical and art-poetical
treatises, entirely in Latin, between the sixth century
and the thirteenth, the solitary document of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De vulgari
Eloquio</cite></span> at the central point of the history, and perhaps some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>more <cite>Rhetorics</cite> and <cite>Poetics</cite>, now dealing in increasing measure
for moderns with the modern tongues, between 1300 and 1500.
But we shall derive most of our material, and almost all the
more interesting part of it, from incidental expressions on
literary matters in books not professedly rhetorical or critical.
And, taking century by century and beginning with the Fifth,
we are lucky in finding at once, in the latter part of this, an
interesting and half-famous writer who stands at the gate of
the Dark Ages, but is something of a Janus, avowedly looking
back on classical times, and, Christian as he is, admiring
classical writers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The literary references in the works of Sidonius Apollinaris<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c008'><sup>[467]</sup></a>
are pretty numerous, and no small proportion of them possesses
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Sidonius
Apollinaris.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
direct or indirect critical bearing. On the rather
numerous occasions when the good count-bishop
puts a little thing of his, in easy or flebile verse, into his letters,
he by no means seldom prefaces or follows it with a little
modest depreciation; he has not a few references to books
and reading, and now and then he criticises in form. We
could therefore hardly have a fairer chance of knowing what,
at the very eleventh hour and fiftieth minute of the classical
period, was the general state of literary taste in the West.
That Sidonius was a very well-read man, not merely for his
time, and that he had access not merely to most of the things
that we have but to many that we have not, is sufficiently established
by this evidence. And that he did not merely read but
marked—that he endeavoured to shape a style for himself from
his reading—is equally certain. Nor would it be any argument
against his critical competence that this style is, if not exactly
harsh, or even very barbarous, marked by the affectation and
involution which seem to beset alike periods of immaturity and
periods of decadence, and which were specially likely to affect
a period of both at once.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is not easy to rank him very high. His critical utterances
have a besetting tendency to run off into those epithet-tickets
which have been referred to more than once, and which were
the curse of the routine criticism of antiquity. Still, he is very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>interesting both for his position and for his intrinsic characteristics:
and a selection from the passages bearing on the subject
which I have noted in my reading may, as in former cases, be
of service.</p>

<p class='c001'>The very dedication of the Epistles to Constantius shows him
to us as modestly endeavouring to follow, if without presumptuous
footsteps, “the roundness of Symmachus, the discipline
and maturity of Pliny,” for he will not say a word of Cicero,
referring only to an odd criticism of that master<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c008'><sup>[468]</sup></a> by Julius Titianus,
and to an expression of the school of Fronto, “the ape
of the orators,” applied to Titianus himself. The description<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c008'><sup>[469]</sup></a> of
the villa at Nîmes which, from Gibbon’s<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c008'><sup>[470]</sup></a> introduction of it, is
perhaps better known than anything else of Sidonius, includes
that of a library containing religious works arranged in cases
among the armchairs of the ladies, and a collection of profane
authors near the men’s seats. Thus not merely Augustine,
Prudentius, and the Latin translation of Origen by Rufinus, but
Varro and Horace, received attention; while the excellence of
Rufinus’ work is brought out by a critical allusion to the translations
by Apuleius of the <cite>Phædo</cite>, and by Cicero of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De
Corona</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The metrical questions which were becoming of such immense
critical importance, in consequence of the impingence of vernacular
accent and rhythm on Latin, are frequently touched
upon by Sidonius, not, of course, with a full (that was impossible),
but with a fair, sense of their magnitude. He thinks,
justly enough (Ep. ii. 10),<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c008'><sup>[471]</sup></a> that “unless a remnant, at any rate,<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c008'><sup>[472]</sup></a>
vindicates the purity of the Latin tongue from the rust of
barbarism, we shall soon have to bewail it as utterly abolished
and made away with.” And then he justifies himself for
writing a “tumultuous poem” on the church of “Pope”<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c008'><sup>[473]</sup></a> Patiens
at Lyons in hendecasyllabics (which he seems oddly to
call “trochaic triplets” here, as looking at the end only), because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>he wished not to vie with the hexameters of the eminent poets
Constantius and Secundinus.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a glance in iii. 3,<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c008'><sup>[474]</sup></a> which may excite indignation
in the apostles of the “Celtic Renascence,” at the nobility of
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His elaborate epithet-comparison</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
his correspondent “dropping its Celtic slough” and
“imbuing itself, now with the style of oratory, now
with Camenal measures.” This was his brother-in-law
Ecdicius, son of the Emperor Avitus. The epithets come
now in single spies, now in battalions. In a very interesting
letter (iv. 3), addressed <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Claudiano suo</i></span> (not, of course, the poet,
who was dead before Sidonius was born), he says that if the
“prerogative of antiquity” does not overwhelm him he will
refuse, as equals, the gravity of Fronto and the thunder of
the Apuleian weight; nay, both the Varros, both the Plinys.
Then, after an equally hyperbolical praise in detail, he addresses
Claudian’s work as “O book, multifariously pollent! O language,
not of a thin, but of a subtle mind! which neither
bombasts itself out with hyperbolical effusion, nor is thinned
to tameness by <i>tapeinosis</i>!” And later:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Finally, no one in my time has had such a faculty of expressing
what he wished to express. When he<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c008'><sup>[475]</sup></a> launches out
against his adversary he claims, of right, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>symbola</i></span> of the
characters and studies of either tongue. He feels like Pythagoras,
he divides like Socrates, he explains<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c008'><sup>[476]</sup></a> like Plato, he is
pregnant like Aristotle; he coaxes like Æschines, and like
Demosthenes is wroth; he has the Hortensian bloom of spring,
and the fruitful summer<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c008'><sup>[477]</sup></a> of Cethegus; he is a Curio in encouragement,
and a Fabius in delay; a Crassus in simulation,
and in dissimulation a Cæsar. He ‘suades’ like Cato, <i>dis</i>suades
like Appius, <i>per</i>suades like Tully. Yea, if we are to bring the
holy fathers into comparison, he is instructive like Jerome,
destructive like Lactantius, constructive like Augustine; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>soars like Hilary, and abases himself like John; reproves like
Basil, consoles like Gregory; has the fluency of Orosius, and
the compression of Rufinus; can relate like Eusebius, implore
like Eucherius; challenges like Paulinus, and like Ambrose
perseveres.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As for hymns "your commatic is copious,<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c008'><sup>[478]</sup></a> sweet, lofty, and
overtops all lyrical dithyrambs in poetical pleasantness and historical

truth. And you have this special peculiarity,
that while keeping the feet or your metres, the
syllables of your feet, and the natures of your
syllables, you can, in a scanty verse, include rich
words within its limits, and the shortness of a restricted poem
does not banish the length of a fully equipped prose phrase:
so easily do you manage, with tiny trochees and tinier pyrrhics,
to surpass, not merely the ternaries of the molossus and the
anapæst, but even the fourfold combination of the epitrite and
the pæon."</p>

<p class='c001'>In this extravagant, but really interesting and important,
passage, we may probably see the critical taste of the meeting
of the fifth and sixth centuries—of the late classical and the
Dark ages, at its best and most characteristic. Although the
mere taste has lost the power of distinction, it retains distinguishing
formulas. It has learnt, only too much by heart,
certain stock ticket-epithets for distinguished writers, and it
applies them fearlessly and, as far as rote goes, well. Secondly,
we see that a not unimportant habit of comparison had grown
up between the old Pagan and the new Christian literature.
Thirdly, that Sidonius was well aware that all poets of his time
by no means kept “the feet of their metres, and the syllables of
their feet, and the natures of their syllables.” And fourthly,
that a lively sense of metrical <em>quality</em>—of the effects that a
poet can get out of metre—existed in him. Fortunately, this
sense survived and flourished: and it had almost everything to
do with the formation of the prosody of the new languages.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>The promise of the twelfth epistle of the same book,<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c008'><sup>[479]</sup></a> which
opens with a picture of the poet-bishop’s son reading Terence
(the <cite>Hecyra</cite>), while his father expounded the parallel passages
in Menander’s Ἐπιτρέπων is not maintained. But the words,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Gaius Tacitus unus ex majoribus tuis</i></span>, opening another letter<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c008'><sup>[480]</sup></a> to
a certain Polemius, bring us once more close to literary matters,
though only to hear that (in a characteristically Sidonian calculus)
Polemius might vanquish, not only Tacitus in oratory
but Ausonius (another, and perhaps more authentic, ancestor)
in verse. If we had a few more details, the letter to Syagrius
(v. 5) on his acquired skill in German speech<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c008'><sup>[481]</sup></a> would be priceless;
as it is, it is rather tantalising. But yet another list<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c008'><sup>[482]</sup></a> of
flattering comparative tickets is valuable because it refers in
the main to lost authors. The diction of Sapaudus is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tam
clara tam spectabilis</i></span>, that “the division of Palæmon,<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c008'><sup>[483]</sup></a> the gravity
of Gallio, the copiousness of Delphidius, the discipline of
Agroecius, the strength of Alcimus and the tenderness of Adelphius,
the rigour of Magnus and the sweetness of Victorius, are
not only not superior but scarcely equal.” And then, with a
sort of apology for this hyperbolical catalogue, he cites the
“acrimony” of Quintilian and the “pomp” of Palladius as
perhaps comparable. The sixth and seventh books are, the first
wholly, the second mainly, occupied with letters to bishops, of
whose interest in literature Sidonius might not be sure, or to
whom he might not care to parade his own. But the eighth<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c008'><sup>[484]</sup></a>
opens with one of those references to the nasty critics, the
envious rivals and derogators, who play the part of Demades to
Demosthenes and Antony to Cicero, and of whose likes we
have perhaps heard from writers later than the Bishop of
Clermont. Their “malice is clear while their diction is obscure,”
a play, of course, on the double meanings of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>clarus</i></span> as
“clear” and “illustrious,” and of “obscure” as still observed.
And the third letter of the same has reference to an accompanying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>translation of the <cite>Life of Apollonius</cite>, not straight from
Philostratus, but as Taxius Victorianus did it from a recension by
one Nicomachus—which the author depreciates as, by reason of
haste, a confused and headlong and “Opic” translation, thrown
out in a rough-and-ready draft.</p>

<p class='c001'>The eleventh<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c008'><sup>[485]</sup></a> contains a much longer critical passage, of
something the same character as that quoted and analysed
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>A deliberate
critique.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
above. The death of a certain Lampridius gives
Sidonius an opportunity of copying one of the
little things above noted, which had been composed in the
lifetime of its subject, instead of an elegy, and of praising
the Ciceronian, Virgilian, Horatian, and other accomplishments
of that subject as usual. A prose eulogy follows—a passage
among the best of its author’s for the real feeling and force
of its descant on the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>necessitas abjecta nascendi, vivendi misera,
dura moriendi</i></span>, in which we hear approaching the true
Mediæval tone. The praise is by no means unmixed as
far as character goes; it only approaches panegyric when it
comes to the literary part. In orations, it seems, the defunct
was “keen, round, well composed and well struck off,”<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c008'><sup>[486]</sup></a> in
poems “tender, good at various metres, and a cunning craftsman.”
His verses were “very exact but singularly varied both
in foot and measure,” his hendecasyllables were “smooth and
knotless,” his hexameters “detonating<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c008'><sup>[487]</sup></a> and cothurned (fitted
for the buskin)”; his elegiacs “now echoing, now recurrent, now
joined at end and beginning by anadiplosis” (the “turn of
words” in which the decadence bettered Ovid). In his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“ethica
dictio”</span> (probably equal to “ethopoeia”) he did not use words
as they came, but selected “grand, beautiful, carefully polished”
ones.<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c008'><sup>[488]</sup></a> In controversy he was strong and nervous, in satire
careful<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c008'><sup>[489]</sup></a> and biting, in tragic passions fierce or plaintive, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>comic urbane and multiform, in his fescennines showing the
bloom of spring (we know this Euphuism) in his words, the
warmth of summer in his wishes; watchful, economical, and
“carminabund”<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c008'><sup>[490]</sup></a> in bucolics, and in Georgics so rustical as to
have nothing clownish about him. His epigrams aimed not
at abundance but point; they were not shorter than a distich
or longer than a quatrain; they were not seldom peppered,
often honeyed, always salt. He followed Horace in swift
iambics, weighty choriambics, supple Alcaics, inspired Sapphics.
In short, into whatever form of expression his mind carried
him, he was subtle, apt, instructed, most eloquent, a swan like
to soar, with wings only inferior to those of Horace himself and
Pindar. And envious fate has left us not a note of this swan’s
song!<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c008'><sup>[491]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>We may close the account of the Sidonian criticism in prose
with a mere reference to the curious list of symbolic gestures
and features of the philosophers in ix. 9. His poems need not
detain us; but reference should also be made to the verse enclosure
in Epist. ix. 13, containing glosses on different metres<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c008'><sup>[492]</sup></a>
and poetic forms; to the exposition of “recurrent” verses in the
succeeding letter, as well as, in the <cite>Carmina</cite>, to the long list,
with critical remarks, of authors in ix.; to the very interesting,
and to this day sound, justification of the introduction of exotic
words and neologisms when necessary, in the prose preface to
xiv.; and to a crowd of literary references in xxiii.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have been somewhat copious in dwelling on the bishop-count-poet,
because he is infinitely the most valuable document
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Cassiodorus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that we have as to the highwater-mark of the
state of critical knowledge and opinion with which
the Dark or Earlier Middle Ages started.<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c008'><sup>[493]</sup></a> We have in the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>book examined the chief text-book of formal grammar and
Rhetoric, that of Martianus, with which they were already
provided, and we need only glance at two other standards of
theirs, Boethius and Cassiodorus, who come close in time to
Sidonius, and probably to Martianus likewise. Cassiodorus
wrote, like Capella, on the Liberal arts, though in a manner at
once informal and less fantastic, and his influence in encouraging
the frequenters of the mediæval <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>scriptorium</i></span> to copy
ancient manuscripts deserves eternal gratitude. But I have
not yet discovered in him much material for our special
inquiry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is the great name of Boethius here as great as elsewhere.
He wrote, indeed, on rhetorical <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>loci</i></span>, and the author of the
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Boethius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
metres in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Consolatio</cite></span><a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c008'><sup>[494]</sup></a> deserves no mean place in
creative literature. But if he had taken any really
keen critical interest in books, for their form as distinguished
from their matter, it must have appeared in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Consolatio</cite></span>
itself. On the contrary, as everybody knows who has ever
looked at the book, it begins with Philosophy packing the
Muses off as “strumpets and mermaidens” in a tone half-suggestive
of Plato a little the worse for Augustine. And
though the “suasion of sweetness rhetorien” is afterwards
patronisingly spoken of (Book II., Prose i.), and Homer with
the honey-mouth, Lucan, and others are quoted, yet Rhetoric is
expressly warned that “she goeth the right way only when
she forsaketh not <em>my</em> statutes.” Moreover, the beautiful metre
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Vela Neritii ducis</i></span> is a merely moral, and almost merely allegorical,
playing on the story of Circe.</p>

<p class='c001'>We can, however, see from the comparison some useful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>things. The stock of actual erudition possessed by at any rate
some persons was considerable; but the number of
these persons was not very large, and both the
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Critical attitude of the fifth century.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
“remnant” itself<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c008'><sup>[495]</sup></a> and its accomplishments were
likely to decline and dwindle. The new vernaculars were
already assuming importance; men were likely<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c008'><sup>[496]</sup></a> to be chosen
for positions of ecclesiastical eminence (almost the only ones
in which study of literature was becoming possible), because of
their bilingual skill, or to be driven by such positions to study
of the vernacular. And this bilingualism was likely not merely
to barbarise even their Latin style, but to draw them away from
the study of classical Latin, and still more Greek. In regard to
the latter, we see further, from two passages of Sidonius quoted
above, that persons of very considerable education were apt
to use translations of the Greek fathers, as well as of Pagan
writings, in preference to the original. Yet again we see that
even the most accomplished scholars of the time (and Sidonius
himself may certainly claim that distinction) were, on the one
hand, more and more acquiescing in what, to borrow Covenanting
phraseology, we may call the “benumbing, deadening, and
soul-destroying” list of ticket-epithets: and, on the other, were
gradually losing a sense of the relative proportions of things—of
the literary ratio of patristic to classical literature, and of the
productions of their own day to those of the great masters,
whether classical or patristic. And thirdly, we see that even so
careful a metrical student as the Bishop of Clermont was succumbing
to the charm of “recurrent” verses, acrostics, telestics,
and all the rest of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, this process of “losing grip” is very far
from the state in which we find it by the time that we are in
full Middle Age: and, for good as well as for evil, the glorious
hotch-potch of that period is still distant. Virgil is not yet an
enchanter or anything like it: he and his works are perfectly
well placed in their proper literary and historical connections.
If, on the side of form, there is perhaps already a rather perilous
tendency to see no very great difference between Orosius and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>Livy, there is none to put Dares (who probably did not exist)
on a level as an authority with Homer, or above him, in point
of matter. And while the fables about Alexander probably <em>did</em>
exist, men of education did not think of mixing them up with
the facts.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most favourable sign of all, however, is that metrical
solicitude which has been already more than once referred to.
The anxiety which Sidonius shows to suit his metres to his
subject would do credit to a much better poet in a much more
“enlightened” age; and it is surely not fantastic to see in his
constant reference to success or failure in adjusting “syllables
to feet, and feet to measures,” that the difference of the classical
prosody from the newer, half-accentual quantification even
in Latin, and from the vernacular rhythms sounding all over
Europe, was forcing itself, consciously or unconsciously, on his
mind. And it cannot be repeated too often that to construct
and perfect new prosodies, in Latin and in the vernaculars alike,
was perhaps the greatest critical-practical problem that the
Middle Age had before it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sixth century has even fewer lights among its gathering
gloom; in the beginning and at the end of the seventh a kind
of rally of torches is made by Isidore and Bede.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The sixth—Fulgentius.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
There are, however, two authors at least in the
sixth who are full of significance, even if that significance be
too much of a negative kind. These are the African grammarian
Fulgentius, with his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Expositio Virgiliana</cite></span>, probably in the
earlier half, and the poet-priest Venantius Fortunatus, certainly
in the later.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fulgentius<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c008'><sup>[497]</sup></a> holds something like a position in the history of
Allegory, being not infrequently breveted with the rank of go-between,
or the place of fresh starting-point, between the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>development of the purely classical allegory in Claudian, and
the thick-coming allegoric fancies of the early Christian
homilists and commentators, which were to thicken ever and
spread till the full blossoming of Allegory in the <cite>Romance of
the Rose</cite>, and its busy decadence thenceforward. Unluckily,
Allegory was, as we have seen, no novelty in criticism; but
rather a congenital or endemic disease—and Fulgentius only
marks a fresh and furious outburst of it. Virgil, a favourite
everywhere in the late Roman world, was, it has been said, an
especial favourite in Africa: and Fulgentius would appear to
have given the reins, not exactly to the steed, but to the ass, of
his fancy, in reference to the Mantuan.</p>

<p class='c001'>The writings of the Fulgentian clan (none of which, fortunately,
is long) consist of (1) three books of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mitologiæ</cite></span> (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Mythologiæ</cite></span>),
of (2) the <i>Expositio Virgilianæ Continentiæ
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Fulgentii and their books.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
secundum Philosophos Morales</i> which is our principal
text, and of (3) a shorter <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Expositio Sermonum Antiquorum</cite></span>,
attributed to Fabius Planciades Fulgentius, who was
probably of African  birth, and  probably lived in the early
sixth century; of (4) a tractate, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Ætatibus Mundi et Hominis</cite></span>,
attributed to Fabius Claudius Gordianus Fulgentius; and (5)
of a note on the <cite>Thebaid</cite> of Statius, attributed to Fulgentius,
Saint and Bishop. The personalities of these persons are to the
last degree unknown; and it is very uncertain whether they
were in reality one or two or three. The books we may best
cite as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>

<p class='c001'>4 is far better written and more sensible than the others;
but it has nothing to do with our subject. 3 is a short list
(sixteen pages and sixty-two articles) of notes on out-of-the-way
words (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>abstrusi sermones</i></span>), where it is curious to find among
really unusual locutions—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>friguttire</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>suggrundaria</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tittivilitium</i></span>,
and the like—such to us everyday ones as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>problema</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>auctio</i></span>.
2 and 5 concern our business, equally in substance, unequally
in importance and extent, and to understand them both, it is
desirable to read 1 at least cursorily, although it, like them, is
a tissue of appallingly barbarous Latin—enshrining allegorical
interpretations as ridiculous as the most absurd in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Gesta
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>Romanorum</cite></span>,<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c008'><sup>[498]</sup></a> and derivations which in their sheer serious insanity
surpass the most promising efforts of the clever and
sportive schoolboy in the same kind. As no one, I think, who
reads this book will regard me as a detractor of the Dark and
Middle Ages, I may speak here without fear and without
favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having surveyed Mythology from the point of view of the
most grovelling allegory, etymologically assisted by such fancies
as that Teiresias (T<i>e</i>resias in his spelling) is derived
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Super Thebaiden <i>and</i> Expositio Virgiliana.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
from <i>theros</i> and <i>æon</i>, meaning “eternal summer,” and
that Ulixes <i>Græce</i> (it will go near to be thought
shortly that Fulgentius knew less Greek than Shakespeare)
is “quasi-<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>olon xenos</i></span> id est omnium peregrinus,” Fulgentius
seems to have turned to literature. If he also wrote the note
on the <cite>Thebaid</cite> attributed to the Sainted Bishop (and it is
very much in the same style), he confined himself to a brief
argument of the story, with a few etymologies, such as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Creon
quasi cremens omnia</i></span>,” and a short preface. In this he tells us
that he “can never without grand ammiration<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c008'><sup>[499]</sup></a> retract the ininvestigable
prudence of the poets, and the immarcescible vein
of their genius”: and having thus prepared rejoicing for the
heart of the Limousin scholar nine hundred years ahead, he
sets the fashion to Lyly by observing <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Diligit puer nucem ad
ludum integram: sapiens autem et adultus frangit ad gustum.”</span>
But this, though not insignificant, is a slight thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Expositio Virgiliana</cite></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Virgiliana Continentia</cite></span> (this word
being late Latin for “contents”) is itself not long: it fills,
with <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>apparatus criticus</i></span>, some five-and-twenty pages. If it were
not written in a most detestable style, combining the presence of
more than the affectation and barbarism of Martianus with a complete
absence of his quaintness and full-blooded savour, it would
be rather agreeable to read: even as it is, it is full of interest.
We catch Virgil in mid-flight through the void, from that position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>of universal exponent of sober literary art which we have
seen him occupy with Macrobius, to his rank as beneficent enchanter
a few centuries later. The Bucolics and Georgics are
full of such <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Phisica secreta</i></span>, such <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>misticæ rationes</i></span>, that they are
actually dangerous to touch. He has passed over the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>interna
viscera nullius pæne artis</i></span> in these books. In the first Eclogue
he has physically summed up the three lives (active, contemplative,
and enjoying); in the fourth, he is a prophet; in the
fifth, a priest; in the sixth, partly a musician, partly a physiologist;
in the seventh, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>botanicen dinamin tetigit</i></span>, he has touched
the power of botany;<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c008'><sup>[500]</sup></a> in the eighth he has pointed out magic
and the apotelesmatic of the musician; combining this with
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>euphemesis</i></span>,<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c008'><sup>[501]</sup></a> in the ninth.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first Georgic he is throughout an astrologer and then
a “eufemetic”; in the second, a physiologist and medical man;
in the third, wholly an aruspex; and in the fourth, is to the
fullest musical. But Fulgentius will not meddle further
with the details of these books; and, after a breathless and intricate
prologue, attacks the <cite>Æneid</cite> in a manner easily to be
conjectured from what has been said. Every word, every
syllable almost, of the first line, is tortured to yield an allegory;
the account being thrown into the form, first of a dialogue between
poet and interpreter, and then of a long speech from the
former. Achates is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Græce quasi <i>aconetos</i> id est tristitiæ consuetudo.”</span>
Iopas is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“quasi <i>siopas</i> id est taciturnitas puerilis.”</span>
The progress of the story is the growth of human life. The
wanderings of the first three books are the tales that amuse
youth; the fourth shows how love distracts early manhood; the
fifth displays it turning to generous exercises; the sixth is deep
study of nature and things; the rest active life. And if anybody
wishes to know why Turnus’ charioteer was called
Metiscus, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Metiscos enim Græce est ebriosus.”</span></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>It cannot be necessary to say much of this, which speaks for
itself; it is, as we said at first, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>intellectus</i></span> (or rather the
want of intellect) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sibi permissus</i></span> and expatiating unchecked.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Qui l’aime le suive!</i></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Venantius Honorius Clementianus Fortunatus<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c008'><sup>[502]</sup></a> (for a plethora
of names was as characteristic of the Latin as of other decadences)
is a much more interesting figure, and his
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Venantius Fortunatus.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
critical importance, if less direct, is not really inferior.
He goes in the general literary memory with Sidonius,
as the twin-light of not yet wholly barbaric Gaul; and he had
probably more original poetic gift than his predecessor. At
least, I can find nowhere in Sidonius anything approaching the
throb and thrill of his two great and universally known hymns,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Pange Lingua</cite></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vexilla Regis</cite></span>—the earliest, perhaps, to attain
that ineffable word-music of hymn-Latin, which is entirely independent
of mere tune, mere setting, and which is not only
equal to, but independent of, the choicest sound-music of either
ancient or modern verse. He was also a livelier writer; and
though he has made even further progress in the direction of
affectation and bombast, these things rather add a piquancy,
if not to his painful official praises of Queen Brunehault, at
any rate to his expression of his half-pious, half-human affection
for Radegund the Queen and Agnes the Abbess, his
account of the sad results when the hospitable Mummolenus<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c008'><sup>[503]</sup></a>
would make him eat too many peaches, and his admirable
description of his sail on the Moselle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, he was certainly accomplished in all the learning
of his time. He could even write very fair, if not delightful,
sapphics. And he is not to be treated with the scornful contempt
which some have heaped upon him, merely because he
composed (with an amount of labour which makes one’s brain
and eyes ache to think of) acrostics and cross-poems of various
degrees of artificiality. He has one marvellous structure of
the latter kind,<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c008'><sup>[504]</sup></a> in which not only do the frame-letters of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>scheme make sense, but correspondences, interwoven in the text
trace out, also in sense, a sort of cross <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>patée</i></span>, as thus:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i412.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c023'>Here the dots represent (though they are fewer) letters doing
double duty, as part of sentences straight across, and in the
lines of the figure itself. “The grace and liberty of the composition,”
as some one says, may indeed be lost in such intricacies,
yet are they not in themselves unliterary as a pastime.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must, however, be most frankly confessed that the literary
expressions and references which we find in Fortunatus are
(in the sense in which the word has so often to be used in this
part of our work) “tell-tales.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Preface of his Poems,<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c008'><sup>[505]</sup></a> addressed to Pope Gregory, opens
with a somewhat emphatic and inflated laudation of the great
men of letters of old, who were, we learn, "provident in invention,
serious in partition, balanced in distribution, pleasant
with the heel of epilogues, fluent with the fount of bile,
beautiful with succise terseness, adorned from head to foot
[literally "alike crowned and buskined"] with tropes, paradigms,
periods, epicheiremes," which gives us a pretty clear idea of what
seemed to Fortunatus to be literature. It contains also some
touches of the “Italic”<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c008'><sup>[506]</sup></a> writer’s contempt of those who “make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>no distinction between the shriek of the goose and the song of
the swan,” who love “the harp buzzing barbarous <i>leods</i>.” But far
fewer direct references to literature occur in these poems than
in those of Sidonius. In II. ix.,<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c008'><sup>[507]</sup></a> to the Parisian clergy who bade
him resume his long-abandoned lyre, he takes it up purely as
the hymn-writer, not the man of letters. There is more of the
attitude of the latter in the prose epistle (III. iv.)<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c008'><sup>[508]</sup></a> to Bishop
Felix, but it does not come to very much. In the tenth of the
same book,<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c008'><sup>[509]</sup></a> the same bishop (who had, it seems, turned a river
from its course) receives a complimentary reference to Homer,
but none to Herodotus. Yet another bishop (of the undeniably
Frankish name of Bertechramnus) is complimented, in the
eighteenth, on his epigrams.<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c008'><sup>[510]</sup></a> But Fortunatus, after much applause,
does not fear (let us hope that the Frank was more
placable than his brother prelate of Granada later) to add—</p>

<p class='c021'>The epistle to Syagrius of Autun (V. vi.)<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c008'><sup>[513]</sup></a>, which introduces
another elaborate cross-poem, contains a vindication of it, by a
twist of the Horatian tag to the effect that as painting and
poetics are so like, why should you not combine them in such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>a fashion? After which the intricacies of the poem itself are
carefully explained. The reference to “us Romans” in the
poem to Sigebert (V. ii. 98)<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c008'><sup>[514]</sup></a> (where he compliments the king
on his skill, Sicambrian as he is, in the Latin tongue) suggests
that the writer would have been scantly grateful for the
inclusion of his work among “Monumenta <em>Germaniæ</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The genuine prose works of Fortunatus, consisting only of
a few Saints’ Lives, do not promise much; but there is at
least one remarkable passage in them. It is the opening of
the Life of Saint Marcellus<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c008'><sup>[515]</sup></a> in which his customary deprecation
takes this form. “Illustrious orators of the most
eloquent genius, whose speeches are distinguished by varied
flowers, and shadowed by the vernal tendrils of eloquence, are
wont deliberately to seek common causes and sterile matter,
that they may show themselves as possessing an inexhaustible
flow of speech on the smallest subjects, and as able to inundate
the dryest themes with their internal founts of rhetoric. Men
not so clever cannot even treat great subjects,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c001'>And this, falling in with the other glimpses we have obtained,
gives no misty view of the critical standpoint of this agreeable
writer. The literary <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nisus</i></span>, the literary tone, are fairly well
maintained; there is no glaring lack of positive knowledge;
and neither style nor sense shows anything like the degradation
of Fulgentius. But Fortunatus, far more than Sidonius, is, in
the good old phrase, “to seek” in the general field of matters
literary, and especially in its critical quarters. Glitter and
clatter, tinsel and crackers, are in prose, if not in verse (he
is far more sober there), too much his ideals. The curse of
the ancient formal Rhetoric has so far outlasted its blessings,
that the expression of opinion last quoted would suit, and
almost exaggerate, the position of the worst of the old
declamation-makers. As to prosody, he has to some extent,
if not wholly, “kept the bird in his bosom,” and his affection
for subtleties in arrangement is, as has been said, not so
wholly to his discredit as Mr Addison and Mr Pope thought.
But it is rather a dangerous support; and he has very few
others.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>As Fulgentius and Venantius have stood for the sixth, so
Isidore and Bede<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c008'><sup>[516]</sup></a> may stand for the seventh century, while
Bede’s flourishing time stretches into the eighth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Isidore’s treatment of Grammar<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c008'><sup>[517]</sup></a> is much fuller than his
handling of her showier sister Rhetoric.<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c008'><sup>[518]</sup></a> It fills the whole of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Isidore of Seville again</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the First Book of the curious Encyclopædia called
the <cite>Origines</cite>, and is much more liberally arranged
than the usual grammatical treatise, including a great deal
of applied matter of various kinds, visibly filching Tropes and
Figures from Rhetoric herself, and, besides dealing with
Prosody, even devoting sections to the Fable and to History
under more than one head. There is much interesting (if not
for us strictly relevant) matter in the earlier chapters, where
we read that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>literæ</i></span> are <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quasi legiteræ</i></span>, and that Greek and
Latin appear to have arisen out of Hebrew. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vitia</i></span>,
from barbarism and sol&oelig;cism downwards, are pure Rhetoric,
containing, as they do, things like <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tapeinosis</i></span> and amphibology,
with which Grammar, as such, has certainly nothing
to do; and they are near the rhetorical side of Criticism
herself. The Metaplasms which follow, as purely verbal,
may be claimed by the elder sister, but the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>schemata</i></span> and
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tropi</i></span> are unquestioned usurpations. And thereafter,
with Chapter Thirty-Seven <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Prosa</cite></span>, we are almost on our
own ground.</p>

<p class='c001'>Isidore, if not (save in his title) very original, is judicious in
his selections from the public stock, and puts them together in
a much more useful fashion than some authors of “composition-books”
a good deal his juniors. Prose is “a straightforward
form of speech freed from metre.” Metres (he has given “feet”
a good deal earlier) are the fixed arrangements of feet which
constitute verse. Their names are classified and accounted for,
as are, subsequently, the chief forms of poetry in which they
appear. The origination of these is claimed for various sacred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>persons—of the Hymn for David, “who was long before Ennius,”
of the Epithalamium for Solomon. Not a few of the definitions,
though desultory and oddly selected, are noteworthy, and the
considerable space given to that of the Cento is characteristic
of the age.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fable, as has been said, has a section to itself, an honour
which is prophetic of—and considering Isidore’s influence may,
to some extent, have caused—the great attention paid in the
Middle Ages to that kind. The History sections, though four
in number, are much shorter—indeed, scarcely so long together
as the single one allotted to Fable, which fact also is true, as the
needle is, to the pole of the time. It is much better, Isidore
thinks, that a man should only write of what he has actually
seen. But History is not useless reading. Strictly, it is of our
own time; “Annals” of the past; while Ephemeris is a diurnal
and Kalendarium a monthly history. Finally the book ends
with a contrast of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>historia</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>argumentum</i></span>, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fabula</i></span>. The first
is of true things really done; the second of things which,
though they have not been done, might be; the third of things
which neither have been done nor can be, because they are
contrary to nature. Here <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>argumentum</i></span> clearly looks towards
oratory: with regard to the difference between <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>historia</i></span> and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fabula</i></span>, it must be admitted that the ages which followed
very scrupulously forgot their teacher’s warning.</p>

<p class='c001'>But even this does not exhaust our indebtedness to a very
agreeable work, full of good sense and sound learning. The
Sixth Book, which begins with an account of the Old and New
Testament, diverges to the consideration of books generally. A
note on famous libraries leads Isidore to record the chief
authorities on Biblical Exegesis, from whom he passes to Latin
libraries, to others (those of the Martyr Pamphilus and of
Jerome), and thence to authors. Much writing attracts him
first: and Varro, the Greek Chalcenterus, Origen, and St
Augustine are picked out, the not entirely single-edged compliment
being paid to the last, that not only could nobody
write his books by working day and night, but nobody could
read them completely by a similar expenditure of time and
labour. An odd division of works follows, into <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>excerpta</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>scholia</i></span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>“homilies,” and “tomes” or books,<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c008'><sup>[519]</sup></a> or volumes: and this is
followed by a string of remarks, as before rather desultory, on
different kinds of books and writings, commentaries, prefaces,
and what not. Then Isidore passes to the material side, and
discusses waxen and wooden tablets, parchment, paper, with
something about <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>format</i></span>. The staff and the plant of libraries
follow; and then, returning from things profane to things divine,
the book finishes with an account of the Calendar and the
Offices of the Church.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those to whose taste and intellect this kind of thing appears
despicable must, of course, be permitted to despise it. Others
will prefer to recognise, with interest and sympathy, the combination
of an extremely strong desire for knowledge, and the
possession of no small quantity thereof, not merely with great
disadvantages of resource and supply, but with a most curious
and (if it were not so healthy and so promising) pathetic inability
to distinguish, to know exactly where to plant the grip,
what to discard, what simply to neglect. And they, once more,
will see in this whole attitude, in this childhood crying for the
light, something more encouraging than the complacent illumination
of certain other ages, with which, perhaps, they may be
more fully acquainted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bede,<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c008'><sup>[520]</sup></a> a century later than Isidore, presents a changed but
not a lesser interest. It is utterly improbable that the Bishop
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Bede again.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of Seville found himself in face of any vernacular
writing that could be called in the least literary—if
any vernacular except Latin and Old Basque can be supposed
to have existed in Spain at all. Bede’s circumstances were
quite different. The most famous passage in his writings—the
story of Cædmon—is sufficient to tell us, even if we did not
know it from other testimony, and from his extant death-bed
verses, that he was well acquainted with vernacular poetry.</p>

<p class='c001'>But he seems to have thought it either unnecessary or undesirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>to give any critical attention to it. His <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ars Metrica</cite></span><a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c008'><sup>[521]</sup></a>,
like his <cite>Orthography</cite><a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c008'><sup>[522]</sup></a> and his <cite>Rhetoric</cite>,<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c008'><sup>[523]</sup></a> concerns
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His</i> Ars Metrica.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
itself strictly with Latin. That this was on the
whole better for the time, and so indirectly for us, who are the
offspring of that time; that it was better for the vernaculars
to be left to grow and seed themselves, and be transformed
naturally without any attempt to train and so to cramp
them; that it was, on the other hand, all important that the
hand of discipline should be kept on the only “regular”
writing, that of Latin—we may not only admit with frankness,
but most eagerly and spontaneously advance and maintain.
But the carnal man cannot help sighing for a tractate—a
tractatule even of the tiniest—on English verse, from the
Venerable One. There are, however, in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ars Metrica</cite></span> one
large and several small crumbs of comfort. It is a pity that
the learned and accurate Keil should have spoken so scornfully<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c008'><sup>[524]</sup></a>
of the undoubted truth that, while Bede supplements the
precepts of the old grammarians in no whit, his whole usefulness
lies in regard to the examination of more recent poets, and,
as he calls them, “modern versifiers”; and should, a little
further, have still more scornfully declined<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c008'><sup>[525]</sup></a> to trouble himself
with verifying unnamed references to such persons as Prudentius,
Sedulius, Venantius Fortunatus, and others. To despise
any age of literature is not literary: and to ignore it (as the
motto which I have ventured to borrow from the excellent
Leyser hath it in other words) is not safe. I think we may
ask Herr Keil this question, “Is it not exactly of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>moderni
versificatores</i></span> that Bede can speak to us with advantage?” Do
we, except by a supererogation of curiosity, want remarks from
him on Virgil and Ovid?</p>

<p class='c001'>Bede (who addresses the tract to the same Cuthbert whom we
have to thank for the charming account of his death) begins
with the letter, goes on to the syllable, and then has a chapter
of peculiar interest on <em>common</em> syllables—those stumbling-blocks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>to so many modern students of English prosody. The
quantity of syllables in various positions is then dealt with
successively, and next the metres, cæsura, elision, &amp;c. One
may note as specially interesting the section <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Quæ sit optima
Carminis forma</i></span> (p. 243), both as showing long before, in reference
to the hexameter, the same “striving after the best”
which appears in Dante’s extrication of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>canzone</i></span> and the
hendecasyllable from meaner forms and lines, and as indicating
something like a sense of that “verse-paragraph” which was to
be the method of Shakespeare and of Milton. In dealing with
these things he sometimes quotes, and still more frequently
relies upon, Mallius Theodorus. But the passage which, if it
existed alone, would make the book valuable (though in that
case, as no doubt in many others, we should be prone
to think that we had lost something more precious than it
actually is), comes under the head <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Rhythmo</cite></span>. After saying
that the “Common books of a hundred metres”<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c008'><sup>[526]</sup></a> will give many
of these which he has omitted, he goes on thus: “But rhythm
seems to be like metres, in that it is a modulated arrangement
of words, governed not by metrical rule, but <em>by the number of
syllables</em>, according to the judgment of the ear. And there can
be rhythm without metre, though there can be no metre without
rhythm: or, as it may be more clearly defined, metre is
rhythm with modulation, rhythm modulation without proportion.
But for the most part you will find, by a certain
chance, proportion likewise in rhythm: not that any artificial
discipline is used, but from the conduct of the sound and the
modulation itself; and such as the poets of the people
naturally produce in a rustic, learned poets in a learned
manner.”<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c008'><sup>[527]</sup></a> And then he quotes, as examples of iambic and
trochaic rhythms respectively, the well-known hymns, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Rex
æterne Domine</cite></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Apparebit repentina</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now this, which, though partly a result of, is quite different
from, the classical opposition of rhythm and metre, is a thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>of the first importance, and could not have been said by any one
who had neglected the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>moderni versificatores</i></span>: while it would
perhaps not have been said so clearly and well by any one who
had not known, and paid some attention to, the rising vernaculars.
Even if, as Keil thinks, Bede followed such writers
as Victorinus and Audax, he confirmed and strengthened this
following by his study of recent verse.</p>

<p class='c001'>I do not perceive any great crux in this passage: but Guest<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c008'><sup>[528]</sup></a>
was puzzled by the phrase <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>numero syllabarum</i></span>, which he seems to
have taken as meaning that rhythm was more, not less, strict
than metre in syllabic regularity. I am not sure that the words
bear this interpretation: but, even if they did, we must
remember that the rhythms <em>of which Bede was speaking</em> are very
strict syllabically, and admit little or no equivalence. The more
prudish hymn-writers even dislike elision, and give every
syllable its value.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not from caprice or idleness that the somewhat minute
examination thus given to the opening centuries of the Dark
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Central Middle Ages to be more
rapidly passed over.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
or early Middle Ages will now be exchanged for a
more rapid flight over the central portion of the
same division of history. There are two very good
reasons for this course. The first is, that there is
a very great absence, probably of all material, certainly
of material that is accessible. The second is, that even
if such material existed and could be got at, it would probably
be of little if of any service. When conditions of rhythmical
composition in Latin were once settled, that composition was
pursued with delightful results,<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c008'><sup>[529]</sup></a> but with half traditional, half
instinctive, absence of critical inquiry as to form. It was impossible
that any such inquiry should take place, in the case of
the vernaculars, until they had reached a state of actual creative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>development, which none of them enjoyed till the twelfth
century, and hardly any of them till the thirteenth. As for
appreciation, other than traditional, of authors classical, patristic,
or contemporary, this was rendered a rare thing by that
very mental constitution of the Middle Ages which has already
been often referred to, and which will be more fully discussed
in the Interchapter following this book. This constitution,
rich in many priceless qualities, almost entirely lacked self-detachment
on the one hand, and egotistic introspection on
the other. It can very seldom have occurred to any Mediæval
to isolate himself from the usual estimate of writers—to separate
his opinion of their formal excellence from the interest, or
the use, of their contents. And even if it had so occurred to any
one, he would probably not have thought that opinion worth
communicating. From which things, much more than from
the assumed shallowness or puerility, a thousand years saw
an almost astoundingly small change in regard to the matters
with which we deal. Boethius and Martianus are text-books
to the early sixteenth century as to the early sixth: the satirical
lampoons of the religious wars in France burlesque the
form, and use the language, of the hymns of Venantius Fortunatus:<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c008'><sup>[530]</sup></a>
Hawes and Douglas look at literature and science with
the eyes of Isidore, if not even of Cassiodorus. Whether this
conservatism did not invite, disastrously, the reaction of the
Renaissance-criticism, we shall have to consider later; it is
certain that it limits, very notably, the material of the present
book, and especially of this portion of the present <a id='corr406.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='chapter'>chapter.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_406.28'><ins class='correction' title='chapter'>chapter.</ins></a></span>
On two very remarkable books of the earliest thirteenth century,
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span> attributed to Eberhard, and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Nova
Poetria</cite></span> of Geoffrey de Vinsauf, we may dwell with the utmost
advantage. Otherwise a few notes, chiefly on the formal <cite>Arts
Poetic</cite> of the mid-Middle Age, are not only all that need, but
almost all that can, be given before we turn to the great
mediæval document of our subject, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span> of
Dante.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>In the vernacular languages it is hardly necessary to do
more than refer to the instructions for accomplishing the intricacies
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Provençal and Latin treatises.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of Provençal verse found in that tongue;<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c008'><sup>[531]</sup></a>
the Latin rhythmics are rather more interesting.
Until quite recently, access to them, save in the
case of those students who unite palæographical accomplishment
with leisure and means to travel all over Europe, was almost
confined to two precious collections, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Reliquiæ Antiquæ</cite></span>
of Wright and Halliwell, and the plump and pleasing volume
of Polycarp Leyser, which, among its varied treasures, gives the
entire <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span> of Eberhard, the most important of them
all. Now, however, the really admirable industry of Signor
Giovanni Mari has collected, not merely the metrical part of
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span>, and the work (also rather famous) of John de
Garlandia, but no less than six others, all of the thirteenth or
fourteenth centuries.<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c008'><sup>[532]</sup></a> It is indeed not impossible that the first
of these, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Rhythmico Dictamine</cite></span>, may in its original have
been as old as the twelfth, to which the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span> itself used
also to be assigned.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dictamen</cite></span>,<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c008'><sup>[533]</sup></a> the MSS. of which are found all over Europe,
is very short. It lays down firmly the principle, which was
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> De Dictamine Rhythmico.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
later to differentiate Romance from Teutonic, especially
English, prosody, that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rhythmus est consonans
paritas syllabarum sub certo numere comprehensarum</i></span>;
it sets the limits of the line at a minimum of four syllables and
a maximum of fourteen; it designs rhyme throughout as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>consonance</i></span>;
it gives examples from well-known hymns, from the
poems attributed to Mapes and some not elsewhere known;
and it supplies minute distinctions of kind as “transformed,”
“equicomous,” “orbiculate,” “serpentine” rhythms. The tractatule
is strictly limited to rhythm proper: classical metres do
not appear in it. A rehandling by a certain “Master Sion”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>differs in its examples, and is rather more minute in its subdivisions:
and there is yet a third version or pair of versions
showing the authority and general influence of the treatise,
while the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Regulæ de Rhythmis</cite></span> hardly differ essentially, and lead
to the same conclusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ars Rhythmica</cite></span> of John de Garlandia is a much more
elaborate composition, which originally followed upon similar
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>John of Garlandia.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
treatments of “prose” and “metre.” It is remarkable
on the one hand for giving, not mere verses, but whole
poems as examples, and on the other for varying the same
theme in different rhythmical dispositions. The terms of ancient
metric are also borrowed rather more freely than in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dictamen</cite></span>;
and great attention is paid to “rhetorical colours” of
verse—hom&oelig;oteleuton and the like. It is much longer than
any form of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Dictamen</cite></span>, and has a supplement dealing with
the strictly metrical forms usual in hymns. This does not
exhibit the learned John Garland (he may have been an Englishman)
as an expert in literary history, since he writes:
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Saphicum, a Sapho <i>muliere quadam</i> quæ fuit inventrix hujus
metri: adonicum ab Adone inventore.”</span> But in his liberal contribution
of probably original examples he includes an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Oda de
Archidiacono</cite></span>, which might have been useful in a famous investigation.
In fact, probably a major part of the treatise consists
of not very excellent verse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Signor Mari, conformably to his plan, has given of the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span><a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c008'><sup>[534]</sup></a> only the short section dealing actually with
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Labyrinthus.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
rhythm: but the whole poem is of very great interest
and importance for us—indeed of more than
any work known to me between Isidore and Dante. The work,
which is otherwise called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Miseriis Rectorum Scholarum</cite></span>, is an
elaborate treatise on pædagogics. In the progress and details
of this, the writer seems to forget the lugubrious estimate of
his profession with which he starts, and which goes so far as to
lay down that the future schoolmaster is cursed in his mother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>womb. Very sound rules are however given for guiding the
moral nature and conduct of this unfortunate functionary; and
then his various businesses are systematically attacked in
elegiacs, not at all contemptible with due allowance. The
second part deals with “themes,” grammar, and, to some extent,
composition in general, though the examples, like the
lecture, are in verse; the third with versification. And here
we get a really precious estimate of various authors, ostensibly
for their educational value, but, as in Quintilian’s case, going a
good deal further. Indeed, hardly since Quintilian’s own time
have we had such a critical summary. Cato, a special darling
of the Middle Age, is “a path of virtue and a rule of Morals,”
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Critical review of poets contained in it.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
“though the brevity of his metre forbids him to
polish his words.” Theodolus,<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c008'><sup>[535]</sup></a> a tenth-century
writer of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Eclogæ</cite></span>, who “champions” (is this the
sense of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>arcet</i></span>?) the cause of truth against falsehood,
“and in whose verse theology plays,” comes next; and then
the far better known Avianus, the instructive and moral virtue
of whose fables is acknowledged, though he is debited <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pauperiore
stylo</i></span>. In one of the puns so dear to the sensible Middle Ages,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Æsopus metrum non sopit</i></span>—<i>i.e.</i>, writes no dull or sleepy verse—and
is otherwise highly praised. Maximianus<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c008'><sup>[536]</sup></a> and Pamphilus
(the original of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Celestina</cite></span>) follow, and “Geta,”<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c008'><sup>[537]</sup></a> and a
punning reference<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c008'><sup>[538]</sup></a> to Claudian’s <cite>Rape of Proserpine</cite>. Statius,
of course, is praised, indeed twice over. The “pleasing” work
of Ovid, the “satire of the Venusian,” the “not juvenile but
mature” ditto of Juvenal, which “lays bare and never cloaks
vice”; Persius of the lofty soul, who spares no subtlety of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>mind though he is a lover of brevity, come next, while to
these great satirists of old, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Architrenius</cite></span><a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c008'><sup>[539]</sup></a> of John of
Hauteville is yoked, with less injustice than may seem likely to
devotees of classic and scorners of mediæval literature. The
inevitable eccentricity (to <em>us</em>) of the mediæval estimate, and
probably also the perseverance of the wooden censorship of
Servius, is shown by the fact that only Virgil’s “themes,” not
his treatment, are noticed, except obliquely. The second notice
of Statius for the <cite>Thebaid</cite>, as the first had been for the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Achilleid</cite></span>, is less reticent, praising him as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>eloquii jucundus melle</i></span>;
and Lucan is said to sing <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>metro lucidiore</i></span>, while an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Alexandreid</cite></span>
(no doubt that of Gautier of Châtillon), though described as
“shining by Lucan’s light,” is extolled as a historical poem.
Claudian, again by allusion, receives praise for his praise of
Stilicho, and Dares (as we expect with resignation) for his
“veracity”; indeed the clerestories toward that south-north
are quite as lustrous as ebony. Still Homer is placed beside
him without depreciation, unless the mention of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Argolicum
dolum</cite></span> is intended as a stigma. The couplet following—</p>

Tyre or Sidon; and Apollonius <i>of Tyre</i> has very little to do
with <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>prælia</i></span>. The poet alluded to, whoever he is, possesses a
pen with a noble manner. A Salimarius or Solinarius, who sang
of the crusades, may be any versifier of William of Tyre:
unless, indeed, the phrase <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plenus amore crucis</i></span> refers to one of
the numerous poems on the Invention of the Cross. Macer’s
matter is praised, but not his verse, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>non sapit ille metro</i></span>—a true
Quintilianian judgment. Petrus Riga (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>petra cujus rigat Cristus</i></span>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>escapes better. Sedulius is noted for “sedulity” of metre, and
Arator “ploughs” the apostolic facts well, while Prudentius,
of course, is prudent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alanus (de Insulis: “Alanus who was very sage,” as Pierre
de la Sippade, the translator of <cite>Paris and Vienne</cite> from Provençal
into French says) is cited for his dealing with the Seven Arts in
the <cite>Anti-Claudianus</cite>; and half-a-dozen lines of rather obscure
allusiveness are devoted to Matthias Vindocinensis on Tobit,
Geoffrey of Vinsauf (<i>v. infra</i>), and Alexander of Villedieu.

<p class='c001'>This catalogue, partly reasoned, is precious, as showing what
the “Thirty best books” of the age of Dante’s birth were. It is
succeeded by metrical and rhythmical directions, characterised
by a good deal of punning as above, but also by acuteness and
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c001'>The extract from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span> given by Signor Mari is
followed in his book by two other rhythmical tractates of

small importance, one very short, from a MS. in
the Monaco library, and a longer one, but much
later (it is probably as late as 1400), by a certain
Nicolo Tibino. This last is chiefly noteworthy as giving fewer
examples, but much exposition and discussion: it is indeed,
after the custom of these ancestors, a kind of commentary on
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, as it happens, the next piece to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span> in
Leyser is a treatise of interest as great as its own, if not
greater, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Poetria Nova</cite></span> of Geoffrey de Vinsauf. Geoffrey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>who, despite his French-sounding  name, was certainly a
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Geoffrey de Vinsauf: his</i> Nova Poetria.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
countryman of ours, has been rather unkindly
treated by us. Chaucer bestowed upon him one
of his most ingeniously humorous gibes,<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c008'><sup>[541]</sup></a> and Mr
Wright (the most faithful and enthusiastic guardian
and restorer of our Latin poets, and usually as tolerant as any,
this side of mere critical omnivorousness) uses hard language
of him in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Biographia Britannica Literaria</cite></span>.<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c008'><sup>[542]</sup></a> But he is too
valuable to us to be here abused: rather shall we be grateful to
him exceedingly for revealing the literary tastes and ideals of
the age as they lived. The <cite>New Poetic</cite><a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c008'><sup>[543]</sup></a> begins by one of those
mediæval gambades which, themselves sometimes partaking
of the not unamiably nonsensical, seem at the present day to
have a special gift of maddening those persons whose imbecility
is of a different complexion from theirs. Geoffrey dedicates his
poem to Pope Innocent III. (“stupor mundi”), and is at once in
a difficulty. It would not do to call the Pope <i>Nocens</i>; <i>Innocens</i>
is simply impossible in a hexameter. So he plays about the
subject for a score or so of lines, adding eulogistic jocular remarks
on other Christian names, especially in relation to the
Papacy. “Augustine may hold his tongue: Leo be quiet:
John leave off: Gregory halt,”<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c008'><sup>[544]</sup></a> while Innocent is comparable
with Bartlemy in nobility, with Andrew in mildness, with St
John himself in precious youth, in faith with Peter, in consummate
scholarship with Paul. Then Rome is praised in comparison
with England, and the poet-professor-of-poetry plunges
into his subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>His value, even if it were more flawed and alloyed than it is,
will appear at once from the simple statement of the fact that,
unlike the great majority of mediæval writers (such as they are)
on literature, he does not confine himself to form on the one
hand, and on the other does not adopt, in handling his subject,
the extreme cut-and-dried rhetorical restrictions, though his
own conception of the matter is more or less regulated by them.
I do not remember that he ever quotes Horace; but it is pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>certain that he had the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Ars Poetica</cite></span> before him. He opens with
the most solemn and elaborate commands to the poet not to
rush upon his subject, to leave nothing to chance, but to form
the conception of the work carefully and completely beforehand.
“A little gall embitters a whole mass of honey, and one
spot makes a whole face ugly.” In his second chapter he
becomes more closely rhetorical. The poet must first choose
and arrange his subject; then elaborate and amplify it; then
clothe it in “civil, not rustic” words; and lastly, study its
proper recitation or delivery. Under the first head the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mot
d’ordre</i></span> is order: the very word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ordo</i></span> occurs over and over again
in the first dozen or sixteen lines. The exordium must look
straight to the end: and all the other parts must follow according
to the regular drill of a “theme.” Special attention is given
to the employment of Examples and Proverbs. Under the head
of treatment, Brevity, Amplification, and all the scholastic tricks
of style are inculcated again with plentiful examples, these
including that unlucky passage against Friday which tempted
the wicked wit of another Geoffrey. It is, however, fair to say
that He of the Sound Wine does not himself seem to have been
by any means destitute of a certain sense of humour, and demands
ridicule of the ridiculous. If by his precept, and still
more by his examples, Geoffrey seems too much to encourage
word-play as a lighter, and bombast as a graver, ornament of
composition, it is well to remember that the fashions of every
time are not only liable to exaggeration, but nearly always
exhibit it. Professional students of literature have no difficulty
in putting a name to such exaggerations in the thirteenth, the
sixteenth, or the eighteenth century; nor will such students in
the future have any more in performing the same office for the
literary fashions of the late nineteenth. Nor are some of the
prescriptions for figure, and fanciful colour and conceit, by any
means infelicitous—always supposing that such things can be
made the subject of regular prescription at all. On the other
hand, it must be admitted that Geoffrey is sometimes painfully
rudimentary. The budding poet who requires to be told that</p>

however, one of the most interesting points of the book. There
are some two thousand lines in all, and the whole, except the

<p class='c001'>This poem is, on fair authority, assigned to the year 1216, the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span> being dated some four years earlier. And, without
pinning our faith to these dates and so running the danger of
its unsettlement should they be attacked, we may say quite
boldly that the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Labyrinthus</cite></span> and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Nova Poetria</cite></span><a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c008'><sup>[545]</sup></a> together
give us a remarkable and nearly complete conspectus of what
the late twelfth and early thirteenth century thought about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>literature, in what was still its almost all-embracing form—poetry,
in both its rhythmical and metrical shapes—and in the
only thoroughly acknowledged literary language of the time.
For although the vernaculars were already knocking at the
door, they were doing so as yet timidly and half consciously,
while in so far as they were deliberately practised, the principles
of composition and of taste which guided the practice
cannot have been different. We find, if not always with exactly
the same <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>nuance</i></span>, terms of Dante’s critical vocabulary (<i>e.g.</i>,
“pexa”) in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Poetria Nova</cite></span>. And though neither Eberhard
nor Geoffrey would in all probability have had anything but
scorn for the suggestion that “vulgar” could possibly equal
“regular” composition; though they were at best men of
respectable talent; their general critical estimate was probably
not very different from that of their great successor on the
bridge of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Of his
eagle glance into the future of literature they were entirely
destitute, but he shared at least some of their confused vision
in reference to the past.<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c008'><sup>[546]</sup></a></p>

we have only too little from classical
antiquity, and if it were not for the
Halicarnassian and Longinus, should
have quite wofully little. It is the
kind of thing of which we have as
nearly as possible nothing from the

equal directness to the individual, from
the Renaissance; while, though it has
been plentiful enough for the last two

<p class='c001'><a href='#r545'>545</a>. Three other poems of the twelfth
or early thirteenth century (referred to
above) are more original, two of them
at least are more amusing, and all have
obtained more notice from general
literary historians. These are the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Speculum Stultorum</cite></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Brunellus</cite></span> of
Nigel Wireker, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Architrenius</cite></span> (see
p. 410) of John of Hauteville, and
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Anti-Claudianus</cite></span> of Alanus de Insulis.
All three may be found most
conveniently in Wright’s above-cited
work, <cite>Anglo-Latin Satirical Poets of the
Twelfth Century</cite> (2 vols., Rolls Series,
London, 1872). They are by no means
to be neglected by us, though their
testimony is mostly negative, and a
slight reference to its nature will cover,
indirectly, the absence of reference in
the text to such still more generally
famous authors as John of Salisbury and
Walter Mapes himself. It is probable
that all five writers, as well as Godfrey
of Winchester (also in Wright, <i>op.
cit.</i>), who could write fair epigrams in
the more decent style of Martial, and
others, were well acquainted with no
inconsiderable part of the classics.
Upon satirists, moreover, like Wireker
and John of Hauteville, who were
attacking the vanity of monkish and
clerical life, hopes, and ambitions, the
labour-in-vain of Universities, and the
like, some such indirect but substantive
literary criticism as we find in
their Roman originals would seem almost
imperative. But there is nothing
of the kind, either in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Speculum</cite></span>
or in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Architrenius</cite></span>. In the
much duller <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Anti-Claudianus</cite></span>, Rhetoric,
like the other arts, appears, and
she is employed, consistently with her
presentation in Martianus (though the
Rhetoric of Capella would perhaps
have been too proud to do this directly)
to “paint and gild the pole” of the
allegorical Chariot of Prudence. But
of criticism there is nothing, or so
little as to be nothing. Nor will much
be found in the interesting notice of
mediæval notices of books and book
collections which occurs in M. Cocheris’
ed. of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Philobiblon</cite></span> (<i>v. infra</i>, p. <a href='#Page_455'>455</a>),

<p class='c007'>Many are the fortunes of books and the curiosities of them:
but there are few which exceed, in curiosity of many kinds, the
history, character, and fate of the treatise variously entitled <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De
Vulgari Eloquentia</cite></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span>, and attributed
generally, if not universally, to Dante Alighieri.<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c008'><sup>[547]</sup></a> Its mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>history is unusual. In the fifth chapter of the first book of
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> De Vulgari Eloquio. <i>Its history and authentication.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Convito</cite></span>, Dante says that he shall speak elsewhere
more fully, on the subject of Latin and the Vernacular,
in a book which, D.V., he intends to write on
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Volgare Eloquenza</cite></span>. Boccaccio further says that very
near his death he did write it, and the statement is
confirmed by Villani. These mentions give it us as written in
Latin prose and in two books, but after them we hear nothing
about it. In 1529 the poet and dramatist Trissino printed at
Vicenza an Italian translation of it, not under his own name,
but under that of Giovan Battista Doria. No indication was
given that this was not the original, and for a time it was
taken as such. But in 1577 Jacopo Corbinelli published, at
Paris, the Latin Text. The MS. which he used, and which for
centuries was supposed to be unique, appears to be that rediscovered
at Grenoble in 1840, and published in facsimile by
MM. Maignien and Prompt in 1892; but there are two other
early MSS. One of these, belonging to the Trivulzi, is taken
to be as old, perhaps, as the Grenoble, both not improbably
being older than 1400. A third, at the Vatican, is a century
younger, but still some twenty years older than the first printed
(and translated) edition. The usual difficulties have been
started over these facts, and over some supposed contradictions
between the treatise and Dante’s more certain work. But these
concern us little, and may be sought, by those who want them,
in the editions of the book. It is sufficient to say that few
books have a better external testimony, and that the internal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>difficulties (some of which will be referred to later) are quite
insignificant.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may take it then on its own showing; and, without haggling
about dates, be reasonably confident that it was written
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its importance.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
after Dante’s banishment, and of course before his
death—that is to say, in the opening years of the
fourteenth century. Forgery is practically out of the question,
for, as has been said, the oldest manuscripts are some century
and a quarter older than Trissino’s version, and there could be
no conceivable reason why any one late in the fourteenth century—even
if he had the wits to forge such a thing, which is
begging a huge question—should have abstained from reaping
the sole advantage derivable from such a forgery by making it
known as Dante’s. We take it, then—and may take it with
confidence very nearly if not completely absolute—as in two
different ways a document of the very highest value, even before
its intrinsic worth is considered at all. In the first place,
there is the importance of date, which gives us in it the first
critical treatise on the literary use of the vernacular, at exactly
the point when the various vernaculars of Europe had finished,
more or less, their first stage. Secondly, there is the importance
of authorship, in that we have, as is hardly anywhere else
the case, the greatest creative writer, not merely of one literature
but of a whole period of the European world, betaking
himself to criticism. If Shakespeare had written the <cite>Discoveries</cite>
instead of Ben Jonson, the only possible analogue
would have been supplied. Even Homer could not have
given us a third, for he could hardly have had the literature
to work upon.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a matter of fact, however, the book, as I shall hope to
show, would be of almost the highest interest if it were anonymous.
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>And the scanty recognition thereof.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Its intrinsic value has been by no means
universally recognised: indeed I hardly know any
editor or critic of Dante who has put it in quite its
right place. This is, I venture in all humility to think, due
mainly to the fact that the historic estimate of criticism in
general has hitherto been so rarely taken, and so scantily based.
But there are minor reasons. In the first place, the book,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>except by professed Dantists, has been very little studied.<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c008'><sup>[548]</sup></a>
And in the second, what I shall endeavour to prove to be its
greatest value may, in the curious critical prejudices which
still prevail so largely, have told positively against it. It has
shocked people to find the author of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Commedia</cite></span> indulging in
grammatical and prosodic scholasticism; and the shocked ones
either do not pause to ask, or refuse to answer, the question
whether the said scholasticism had not a good deal to do with
the quality of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Commedia</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>As in the case of other books of importance, we may give a
pretty full abstract of the book, which will be all the more
desirable in that it is, as has been said, far from well known.
The Latin, though not very crabbed, is sometimes peculiar, and
some of the terms require careful elucidation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dante begins by stating in due form his reasons for writing;
the absence of any treatise of the kind, the importance of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Abstract of its contents: The “Vulgar Tongue” and “Grammar.”</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
subject, and so forth. He is going to write about
the Vulgar Tongue, and this Vulgar Tongue is that
which we acquire, without any rule, by imitating
our nurses. But, he says, we also have another
and secondary speech, which the Romans called
Grammar. The Greeks also have it, and other nations, but
not all, while comparatively few individuals possess it, because
its acquisition means time and trouble. And the Vulgar Tongue
is nobler, because it is more natural: so we shall treat of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here a slight <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>crux</i></span> arises as to what Dante meant by
“Grammar”: at least (for the first part of his observations is
clear enough) what he meant by saying that “the Greeks have
it, and others but not all.”<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c008'><sup>[549]</sup></a> Are <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Grammatica</cite></span> and “Latin” interchangeable
terms? or does he mean that there was a literary
as well as a vernacular form of Greek, and literary as well as
vernacular forms of Hebrew, Arabic, &amp;c.? The latter seems to
suit the argument best up to a certain point; but it is exposed
to the difficulty that, if so, Dante would be trying to make, out
of the Vulgars, a <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Grammatica</cite></span> for Italian, which nowhere seems
to have been his intention. But it is no great matter.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>He has so far cleared his ground very well; but, to his own
orderly and scholastically educated mind, he does not seem to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The nature, &amp;c., of the gift of speech.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
have done enough. He lays down in chap. ii. that
man alone has intercourse by speech. Angels and
animals do not want it, for angels communicate
intuitively; devils have no need of it;<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c008'><sup>[550]</sup></a> to animals<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c008'><sup>[551]</sup></a> it were useless:
and if anybody urges the serpent in Paradise, Balaam’s
ass, Ovid in the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> about magpies, these objections
can be met in various ways. The real power of speech has
been given to man alone. He needed it (chap. iii.) because
he has both reason and senses, and therefore must have some
medium which will convey the discourse of the former in
a manner acceptable to the latter. It is probable (chap. v.)
that man spoke before woman, though the earliest recorded
speech is assigned to Eve: for man is more excellent. And it
is probable that the first word he spoke was “El,” “God,” and
was addressed to God Himself in Paradise. No doubt (vi.) the
language was Hebrew. Foolish people may be driven (had
Dante heard of the Gaelic claim?) to believe that their own
vernacular was that of Adam. But he knows better. Though
he drank of Arno before his teeth appeared, and loves Florence
so dearly that for the love he bore her is he wrongfully suffering
exile—though for the pleasure of his own senses there exists
no pleasanter place than Florence, yet he thinks that there are
places in the world nobler and more delightful than Tuscany
and Florence, and that many nations and races may use a
pleasanter and handier speech. The consideration of the Flood,
Babel, and the consequent division of speech (chap, vii.) saddens
him very much; but the facts are indisputable.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable that these chapters, coming as they do at
the very outset, have, with hasty readers and thinkers, brought
some discredit on the book. They exhibit what it used to be,
and still is to some extent, the fashion to call the childish side
of mediævalism and scholasticism. Every age no doubt has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>its own childishnesses, and is profoundly convinced that in holding
them it has thoroughly put away childish things. I do not
myself know that, if it were possible to take a simultaneous
horizontal view of the ages, the nineteenth century would be
found so very much in advance of the thirteenth in this respect.
But putting this aside as matter of separable controversy, we
may observe that, in the main body of his argument, Dante
is merely arguing, and arguing very sensibly and closely, from
premisses which no one educated man in a thousand of his
contemporaries would have disputed, and that at the beginning
and end there are very notable things. The notable thing at
the beginning is the separation of “Grammar” and the “Vulgar
Tongue,” and the, at that time, exceedingly bold ascription of
greater “nobility” to the latter.<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c008'><sup>[552]</sup></a> The notable thing at the
end is the unexpectedly cosmopolitan character of Dante’s
sentiments about the excellence of various countries and their
vernaculars. It is true that, for good as well as for evil, there
was about Europe then a certain solidarity which has entirely
disappeared; but local, as distinct from national, patriotism was
as strong, and occasionally as silly, as at any other time. Dante’s
own attitude puts us at once into a position for literary
criticism which neither Greek nor Roman had enjoyed—the
Greek losing it by his arrogant assumption of a solitary literary
position for his own tongue, and the Roman partly by his
imitation of Greek, partly by the lurking desire to make out
that Latin was not so very inferior after all.</p>

<p class='c001'>At any rate, in the chapter (viii.) which follows, there is no
deficiency in what we are pleased to call the scientific spirit;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Division of contemporary tongues</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
on the contrary, any one who knows the historical
circumstances of the time can only be amazed at the
precision, the general justice, and, on the whole, the
particular exactness with which Dante, in full Middle Age,
surveys the languages of Europe. He is well aware of the
threefold general division of language—Teutonic-Slavonic,
Turanian or Tartar, and Romance—and assigns the boundaries
quite correctly. He is further aware of the divisions of
Romance speech itself, and as he had adopted as his criterion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>of Teutonic speech different forms of “yea” (“jo”) for the
word of affirmation, so he uses the same criterion in this case.
Of Romance-speaking nations he says, some say “oc,” some
“oil,” and some “si.” The first are “Spaniards,” the second
Frenchmen, the third Italians. The connection of “Spaniards”
and “oc” need excite no surprise. Castilian, though in existence,
and already provided with the noble <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>Poema del Cid</i></span> and
other documents, was as yet by no means the dominant language
of Spain. In particular, Aragon and Catalonia, which
spoke a Provençal dialect, had far more to do with Italy than
Castile: Galicia, which all Europe visited in pilgrimage to
the shrine of Santiago, also favoured the “oc,” and Provençal
was actually later than this the dialect of Portugal, if not of
all Spain, for certain literary purposes. And the Spanish kingdom
of Aragon was infinitely the most important country that
spoke “oc.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Proceeding, Dante illustrates the relationship of the three
tongues by observing that all call most important things (God,

heaven, earth, living, dying, loving—the selection is
not negligible) by forms of the same Latin originals.
In the next chapter he continues the stress on this
point, producing literary and poetical quotations, from Provençal
(Giraut de Borneil), French (Thibaut of Navarre), and Italian
(Guido Guinicelli), of the word <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Amor</i></span>; and points out—thus
ever drawing nearer, in true methodic way, to his special subject—that
the variations between the three great Romance
speeches are produced, in each language, by dialectic differences.
And he has, on the fact and on the consequent necessity of
establishing some common centrical form by Grammar<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c008'><sup>[553]</sup></a>, observations
which lack neither truth nor sense. Then, Which is
the best of the three Romance forms? He will not say, only
timidly advancing for Italian that <i>si</i> is nearest <i>sic</i>. Otherwise,
each has strong claims. <em>Oil</em> is not only easier and pleasanter,<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c008'><sup>[554]</sup></a>
but whatever has been composed or translated in vernacular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span><em>prose</em> belongs to it, the “most fair intricacies of Arthur,”<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c008'><sup>[555]</sup></a> those
of Trojans and Romans, &amp;c. <i>Oc</i> was first employed for poetry,
being more finished and sweeter. Italian has the sweetest and
most refined poets<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c008'><sup>[556]</sup></a> of all, and seems to be the closest to
“grammar.”<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c008'><sup>[557]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>He will not, however, attempt <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>componere lites</i></span><a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c008'><sup>[558]</sup></a>, but consider
the variations, &amp;c., of the Vulgar Tongue itself—<i>i.e.</i>, Italian—though,
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Italian Dialects: <i>Some rejected at once</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as we shall see, he does not hesitate to draw
illustrations from the others. He first takes the
Apennines as his language-watershed, and allowing
fifteen main dialects, not a few of which are sub-divided,
he proceeds to examine their claims, clearing away
the bad ones. As the Romans think they ought to have precedence<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c008'><sup>[559]</sup></a>
(note the crisp touch of life in this), let us give it
them—by kicking their claims out of the way at once.<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c008'><sup>[560]</sup></a> The
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>alma sdegnosa</i></span> gives something more than a hint of itself in the
description of Roman dialect as a “tristiloquy,” the ugliest of
all the vernacular dialects; which is no wonder, since they stink
worst of all in the deformity of their customs and morals. The
Marchers of Ancona and the Spoletans go next, each of the
rejected ones having a scornful tag of his own barbarism tied to
his tail, as Dante ejects him from the competition. And he tells
us, as if it settled the matter (for, as we shall see, the Canzone is
rather a fetish with Dante), “many Canzoni have been written
in contempt of them.” The Milanese, the Bergamasks, the
Aquileans and Istrians follow, with all the mountainous and
country <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>patois</i></span><a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c008'><sup>[561]</sup></a>, and the Sardinians, who are not Latins, though
“to be joined with them,” and who only imitate Latin as apes
do men. After this rapid sifting (he uses the metaphor) a new
chapter is necessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of those “kept in the sieve” Sicilian claims the first place.
Indeed Dante acknowledges that “whatsoever the Italians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>poetise is called Sicilian.” He admits this, but says it is merely
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Others—Sicilian, Apulian, Tuscan, and Genoese.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
due to the fact that Sicilian princes, or princes resident
in Sicily, Frederick the Emperor and his son
Manfred, have been patrons of literature, and have
thus attached the best Italian genius to the Sicilian
court. But he says (after an indignant digressory denunciation
of contemporary sovereigns) that there is no special value in the
common Sicilian dialect, which indeed is seldom used for poetry
at all, while of that which <em>is</em> used, more to follow. As for the
Apulians, there have been some good writers among them, but
their ordinary speech is spoilt with barbarisms.<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c008'><sup>[562]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But what of the Tuscans? Dante can only repeat that cosmopolitan
criticism, which, though it would be very illiberal to
impute it wholly to his exile, was no doubt assisted thereby.
They may madly assert their title to the possession of the
Illustrious Vulgar Tongue, and even some distinguished men
may have condescended to the Tuscan vernacular. But let us
examine them town by town. Florence, Pisa, Lucca, Siena,
Arezzo are hit off each in a sentence expressing its boast,
and, we may suppose, expressing it with some provincialism.
But Dante says, when men really to be admired, Guido, Lapo,
and “another”<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c008'><sup>[563]</sup></a> of Florence, and Cino da Pistoia, have written,
it is in “curial,” not in the vulgar Tuscan tongue.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the Genoese, the annihilation of the letter Z would
strike them dumb, for they can say nothing without it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he crosses the Apennines<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c008'><sup>[564]</sup></a> and decides successively that
Romagnese, in its various divisions, and Venetian, are full of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Venetian: Some good in Bolognese.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
drawbacks and vulgarities.<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c008'><sup>[565]</sup></a> After which a whole
chapter (xv.) is given to the dialect of Bologna. It
is perhaps better than any other and why? Because
it borrows the best things <em>from</em> the others, as, for instance,
Sordello the Mantuan borrowed from Cremona, Brescia, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>Verona. On the other hand, Ferrara, Modena, and Reggio are
too Lombardic, and though they have lent a touch of piquancy
to Bolognese, cannot create a good literary dialect for themselves.
Still Bolognese, though better than other individual
dialects, because more composite, is not the Illustrious Vulgar
Tongue, for otherwise Guido Guinicelli and other great Bolognese
poets would not have departed from it. So down with
the sieve for, as for places like Trent and Turin, they are too
near the frontier, and if they were <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pulcherrima</i></span> as they are <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>turpissima</i></span>
they would not be <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vere Latinum</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having thus for fifteen chapters pursued a sort of “Rule of
False” in order to catch that panther<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c008'><sup>[566]</sup></a>, the Illustrious Vulgar
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The “Illustrious” Language none of these, but their common measure.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Tongue, by the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a posteriori</i></span> method, Dante determines
to track her <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>. He calls Logic to his aid, and
observes that every individual, species, genus is subject
to a common measure. The measure of individual
conduct is Virtue; of conduct between man
and man, Law; in public behaviour, national manners and
customs. So too there must be some norm, some common
measure of all Italian tongues and dialects, and this, perceptible
in all, abiding in none, will be what is sought for. This is the—</p>

  <ul  class='ul_1'>
    <li>1. Illustre.
    </li>
    <li>2. Cardinale.
    </li>
    <li>3. Aulicum; et
    </li>
    <li>4. Curiale vulgare in Latio.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c023'>Each of these epithets has then to be discussed.</p>

<p class='c001'>So we have the substance, the underlying and fashioning
unity, of Italian defined as a tongue possessing a quadripartite
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its four characteristics.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
differentia, and so it becomes necessary to explain
the four parts. <em>Illustrious</em>, as the seventeenth
chapter, devoted to it, explains, is something that
“shines forth,” <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>illuminans et illuminatum</i></span>. Men are so called
who, having been well trained, are great trainers, like Numa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>Pompilius and Seneca. This is what the Illustrious Vulgar
Tongue of Italy is. It has cleared off much rubbish, as in Cino
da Pistoia. It attracts even the unwilling. It exalts those who
practise it. They surpass kings, marquises, counts. It gives
a glory which even we, exiles as we are, acknowledge as sweetening
the bitterness of our exile. Therefore it is Illustrious.</p>

<p class='c001'>The three other epithets enjoy but a chapter between them.
It is <i>Cardinal</i>, for as a door turns on a hinge, so all the throng
of dialects turns on it. It is <i>Aulic</i>, because, if we Italians had a
Court, it would be spoken there, and because, as a matter of
fact, all those who enjoy courtly frequentation speak it. It is
<i>Curial</i> because, though as in the Aulic case the conditions are
wanting, it would be spoken in the great Law Courts of Italy
if they existed, and it presents the action of a great Court of
Law in trying and sifting cases. This is the proper Italian
language, common to all, aimed at (if unconsciously) by all,
giving the real key to all.</p>

<p class='c001'>And so the first book ends, with the establishment on logical
bases (none the weaker because the struts and props of them
are sometimes decorated with a bygone ornamentation) at once
of the necessity and the fact of a literary language for Italy,
a language combining the merits, and purified from the defects,
of the various local kinds of speech.</p>

<p class='c001'>The First Book of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span> has been chiefly
concerned with language, though—as it is of the very highest
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Second Book—Why Dante deals with poetry only.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
importance to observe—always with a side-glance at
literature. The Second passes to literature itself, at
least to that part of literature which was almost
the only serious part to the earlier Middle Ages—namely,
poetry. If we wanted anything to show us what a
man of letters Dante was, it would be found in the apology
which he makes at the beginning of this book for not dealing
with Rhetoric at large, but only with Poetic. It is simply that
“prosaicants” usually get their language from “inventors,”
and “invention” remains a solid example to them, not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>vice
versa</cite></span>. This, perhaps, with some exceptions (the chief among
them he has himself referred to in citing the French Arthurian
legend), was true in his time, though it was ceasing to be true;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>and a certain amount of truth remains still, greatly as the
circumstances have changed. There is, he goes on to say, a
kind of primacy about verse; so let us deal with it <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>secundum
quod metricum est</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, ought writers in verse to write <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vulgariter</i></span>? Yes, he
thought. The best things require the best language, and that,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>All good poetry should be in the Illustrious.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as we have seen, is the Illustrious Vernacular.
Things not so good will be improved by the best
expression. So all verse-writers should use it, at
least at first sight, though we must alter this conception
on further thought. The Illustrious language demands
illustrious writers (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>alma sdegnosa</i></span> again!), and not only that,
but the best thoughts or subjects. Very inferior persons writing
on very inferior subjects had better <em>not</em> use the Illustrious,
for an ugly woman never looks uglier than when dressed in
gold and silk.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now what subjects are good enough for the Illustrious Vernacular?
Only Three: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Salus</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Venus</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Virtus</i></span>—in other words,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The subjects of High Poetry—War, Love, Virtue.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
War, Love, and Moral Beauty, which means philosophy
<em>plus</em> religion. Dante reaches this conclusion
in the queer-looking but perhaps not easily improvable
manner usual with him, by the <em>prior</em> and
the <em>posterior</em> roads alike. These subjects are, first, the three
things of most importance to a Vegetable-Animal-Rational-creature
like man, and they are also those discussed by the best
writers in the Vulgar Tongue, Bertran de Born, Arnaut Daniel,
Cino da Pistoia, &amp;c. But he does not find that any Italian has
written on the subject of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Salus</i></span> or Arms. (An ominous fact!)</p>

<p class='c001'>So much for subject; now for form. What forms are there
of Illustrious Vulgar Verse? Some have written Canzoni, some
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its form: Canzoni.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Ballades, some Sonnets, some other and irregular
forms. The best of these are Canzoni, for a wilderness
of reasons, good, not very good, indifferent, and bad, the strongest
of which, though not expressed, evidently is that Dante likes
Canzoni best and knows he writes them well. They unite, he
says, all the best points of art; the works of the best poets are
found in them. So let us write of Canzoni, putting off Ballades,
&amp;c., to the Fourth Book—which, alas! we have not.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>What is Poetry? It is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fictio rhetorica in musica posita</i></span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Definition of Poetry.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This is so important that no passing criticism of it
will do, and we must postpone the discussion.</p>

<p class='c001'>But here comes in the curious mediæval humility which made
a poet like Dante regard himself as inferior to Ovid, and
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Its styles and the constituents of the grand style.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Lucan, and Statius. Our poets differ from the
“great” poets, the “regular” ones; but they ought
to approach them as nearly as possible, and, as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Magister noster Horatius</i></span> teaches, take a suitable
subject. And then they must decide what style to write in.
If in the Tragic or Higher style, the Illustrious Vernacular will
be suitable; if in the comic, a mixed or intermediate style; if
in Elegy, the lower. But these two latter are again relegated
to the lost, or never written, Fourth Book. Canzoni must be
written in the Tragic style, and the Illustrious Vulgar Tongue.
This is to be attained when, with the gravity of the meaning, not
merely the pride of the verse, but the loftiness of the phrasing
and the excellence of the words, agrees. It is no light matter
to compose in this way; the most strenuous efforts are necessary.
And, therefore, let the folly of those be confessed who,
guiltless of art and science, and trusting to their wits alone,
break out into the highest song on the highest subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>So the considerations are marked out, the Gravitas Sententiæ
having been already distributed between War, Love, and Virtue.</p>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>1. Superbia Carminum.
    </li>
    <li>2. Constructionis elatio.
    </li>
    <li>3. Excellentia vocabulorum.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c001'>Beginning with metric, Dante, like a sensible man, confines
himself here to the teachings of experience, eschewing all
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Superbia Carminum.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
argument in the vague. What lines have actually
given the best results in the Illustrious Vernacular?
He looks them over, and finds that lines have varied from three
syllables to eleven, that those of five, seven, and eleven are
best of all, and that that of eleven (in which he rightly includes
the French decasyllable with its weak ending) is the best of
these best. Seven comes next; then five, then three. Nine is
not good, because divisible into three threes. Even lines are
“rude,” by which he means (as is undoubtedly true) that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>do not suit the structure of Italian. The hendecasyllable is that
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>superbissimum carmen</i></span> that we sought.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next for the phrase or construction. Here Dante becomes a
little difficult, chiefly because he uses peculiar words, which have
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Constructionis elatio.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
not been always judiciously translated. He says that
there is first the “insipid” style, that without flavour
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sapor</i></span>) or individual character, which merely states a fact, his
example being <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Petrus amat multum dominam Bertam</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next there is the purely “sapid” or tasteful, described oddly
as that of “rigid scholars or masters”; the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sapidus et venustus</i></span>,
which is of those who have drunk superficial draughts of
rhetoric; and the sapid, venust, and also lofty, which is the best
of all. The examples of these shall be given below<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c008'><sup>[567]</sup></a>, but they
are hard to follow in detail, though the classes are clear enough,
corresponding to (1) sheer prose, (2) efforts at style, (3) ornate
prose without much distinction, (4) style achieved.</p>

<p class='c001'>This last, of course, is what the poet must aim at, and again
examples of hitting it are given. But the chapter ends with a
valuable catalogue of the “great,” the “regular” poets: Virgil,
Ovid in the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite>, Statius, and Lucan, with, in prose,
Cicero, Livy, Pliny, Frontinus, and (O ye groves of Blarney!)
Paulus Orosius. Let people read these, and not talk about
Guido of Arezzo.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly the words.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Excellentia Verborum.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Here the subdivision is again of great importance
and some difficulty. Dante distinguishes a
sort of tree—</p>

easy to understand, if sometimes rather hard of application.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, according to Dante, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Pexa et Hirsuta</i></span> are <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>grandiosa</i></span>,
while <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lubrica et reburra in superfluum sonant</i></span>. And it will be
most specially important to use the “sieve,” for, looking to the

<p class='c001'>All this terminology is, of course, more than a little obscure,
and the explanation of the obscurities rather concerns a commentator
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Pexa et hirsuta.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
on Dante than a historian of literary
criticism. But the explanation, given by the critic-poet
himself, of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pexa et hirsuta</i></span> does concern us, and is interesting.
The former, it seems, are words which are trisyllabic,
or “neighbours to trisyllabity,” without an aspirate, without an
acute or circumflexed accent, without double <i>x</i>’s or <i>z</i>’s, without
the conjunction of two liquids, or the placing of them after a
mute, which freedoms give a certain sweetness. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Hirsuta</i></span>, on the
other hand, are all others which, like the monosyllabic pronouns
and articles, cannot be dispensed with, or which, though the
above uglinesses have not been “combed out” of them, still,
when mixed with combed-out words, are ornamental. He
includes in this last class <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>sovramagnificentissimamente</i></span>, a hendecasyllabic
in itself. He would not even mind <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>onorificabilitudinitate</cite></span>,
which has thirteen syllables in two of its Latin
cases, if it were not by its length excluded from Italian verse.</p>

<p class='c001'>So having got the sticks of words for our faggot the canzone,

up<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c008'><sup>[574]</sup></a>, let us set to work to the actual binding and
faggoting, before which something more must be
said about the faggot itself, the Canzone. The Canzone (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cantio</i></span>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>is the action or passion of singing, just as a “reading”
or book (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lectio</i></span>) is the action or passion of reading. A little
metaphysic follows on <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>actio</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>passio</i></span>, and the fact that the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cantio</i></span> is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>actio</i></span> when composed, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>passio</i></span> when sung or acted.
But is the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cantio</i></span> the words or the tune? Surely the words; nobody
calls the tune <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>canzone</i></span>. In fact, all words written for music
may in a sense be called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>canzoni</i></span>, even ballads, even sonnets,
even poems in Latin (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>regulariter</i></span>). But <em>we</em> are speaking of
the supreme canzone, like Dante’s <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Donne ch’ avete</cite></span>. It is “a
tragic composition” of equal stanzas, without <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>responsorium</i></span>
(dialogue or antiphon). The last six chapters concern us less,
because they are wholly occupied with the particular rhyming,
lining, and stanza-fashion of the canzone itself, and, interesting
as they are, overflow our limits, except as a particular example
of the general kind of criticism which has been so laboriously
built up.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the conclusion of this the tractate stops abruptly, nor
have we any indication of what the Third Book was to consist
of, though the Fourth, as we have seen above, is more than once
referred to. The loss of both must be regarded as one of the
most serious that the history of criticism has suffered.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet the possession of what we have is no mean consolation,
and I must be excused for repeating an expression of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Importance of the book.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
extremest surprise at the comparatively small attention
which the book has received, and at the slighting
fashion in which it has been treated by some of those who
have paid attention to it. For myself, I am prepared to claim
for it, not merely the position of the most important critical
document between Longinus and the seventeenth century at
least, but one of intrinsic importance on a line with that of the
very greatest critical documents of all history. There is no
need at all to lay much stress on the mere external attractiveness,
unusual as that may be, of the combination in one person
of the greatest poet and the first, if not the sole, great critic of
the Middle Ages. The tub can stand on its own bottom.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, it only requires acquaintance with that
previous history of the subject, which we have here endeavoured
to unfold, to see that we have the inestimable advantage of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>quite new and independent treatment of that subject. There is
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Independence and novelty of its method.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
no direct evidence that Dante knew the <cite>Poetics</cite><a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c008'><sup>[575]</sup></a>: we
see that he cites Horace and cites him <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>magnificentissime</i></span>.
But the Epistle to the Pisos might never
have been written, for any sign there is of direct influence from
it on Dante’s method. So, too, singular as is the resemblance
between the spirit of him and the spirit of Longinus; remarkable
as is the coincidence between the words of both about words;
and possible as the John of Sicily<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c008'><sup>[576]</sup></a> reference makes it that
Dante might have known the Great Unknown of Criticism—yet
there is not the faintest evidence that he <em>did</em> know him, and an
almost overwhelming probability that he did not. To the
method of no classical predecessor in pure criticism does his
method bear the smallest resemblance, even if faint resemblances
might be pointed out in phrase.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is still more remarkable that, steeped to the lips as he
is in scholastic lore—though <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>trivium</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quadrivium</i></span> must have
been at his fingers’ ends—the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span>, even in mentioning
Rhetoric itself, shows not the faintest tincture of that
scholastic rhetoric which we have noticed. There is not so
much as an allusion to the Figures: they have been, for Dante
on this occasion, as completely banished from <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rerum natura</i></span> as
poor Albucius feared they would be, if his judges disallowed
his pleading.<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c008'><sup>[577]</sup></a> The familiar Arts of Composition make no appearance:
Beginning, Middle, and End are with the Figures. If
we did not know that these things must have been as familiar to
Dante as the alphabet or the multiplication-table to any modern
child, we might think, from this treatise, that he had never
heard of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would seem, indeed, without too much guess-work, that,
despite his attempts to assimilate writing <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vulgariter et regulariter</i></span>,
Dante had an unconscious and an infinitely salutary
instinct, telling him that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>regulariter</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vulgariter</i></span> were <em>not</em> the
same thing. He may have sometimes thought that the former
was the nobler; even in his disdainful soul, the touching humility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>of the Middle Ages existed, as we know, to such an extent that
he could put Virgil, who may be worthy to unloose his shoe-latchet,
in a position above himself. But something must have
warned him to keep the two apart, to approach the criticism
of the illustrious Vernacular literature by a path <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nullius ante
trita solo</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>That path, as has been pointed out, is in fact a double
approach: we might almost say that the restless manymindedness
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dante’s attention to Form.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of Dante attacks the hill on half-a-dozen different
sides at once. We have a chain of mainly <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a
priori</i></span> argument, reaching from the origin and nature
of language to the completely built and fitted-out <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>canzone</i></span>. We
have careful surveys of existing language and literature, with the
keenest observation bent upon what is the actual state of each,
on what each has actually achieved. But besides these two
ways of approach, neither of which is at all like those of the
ancient critics, there is a third difference which is more striking
still: and that is that the critic’s attention is evidently from
the first fixed, not exclusively, but, from the point of view
of his business, mainly, on questions of form, expression, result,
rather than on questions of matter, conception, plan. Not exclusively—let
that be emphatically repeated: but still mainly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again we see, incidentally, but none the less to an important
effect, that he has, no doubt by the mere operation of the lapse
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His disregard of Oratory.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of ages in part, in part by the activity of his own
intellect, and the character of the matter presented
to it, got rid of divers prejudices which weighed upon
the ancients. It is not a just retort, when it is said that he has
completely got rid of the oratorical preoccupation, to say that he
is only dealing with Poetics. For the ancients themselves this
preoccupation was constant, even when they dealt with Poetics;
and Dante does, as a matter of fact, make references to prose
which show that he did not dream (as how indeed should he?)
of oratory having any pre-eminence.   And at the same time that
the fruitful modern literatures helped him to get rid of this,
the greatest drawback or interfering flaw of ancient criticism,
they helped him to get rid of another, the ignorance of prose
fiction. True, he may in his quaint low Latin use <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inventor</i></span> for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>poeta</i></span>; but the simple reference to the prose Arthurian, Trojan,
and Roman legends shows that the gap, which led Aristotle
and all the rest astray, had been filled up.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet again, the character of the Romance poetry which he
chiefly had before him, as well as (if he knew anything of them,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The influence on him of Romance.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which is quite possible) that of the German <em>minnesingers</em>,
was such as to require positively, from any
vigorous and subtle intellect, a quite different treatment
from that appropriate to most ancient poetry. The war-songs
might stand on no very different footing; but, as he
admits, there were no war-songs in Italian. The mystical passion
and the mystical religion of the other two divisions are like
nothing in ancient poetry, except scraps and flashes of things
which must have been mostly unknown to Dante,—the choruses
of the Greek Poets, Catullus, Lucretius, and some things in the
Greek Anthology. There was in most cases no action at all;
the subject, though varying and twisting in facet and form, like
a mountain mist, was always more or less the same; the expression
of the poet’s passionate intense individual feeling and
thought was all, and of this no <em>general</em> criticism was possible.
The forms, on the other hand, the language, the arrangements,
these were matters of intense, novel, and pressing interest. The
ancient critic, at the very earliest date at which we have any
utterances of his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in extenso</i></span>, had a sort of catholic faith already
provided for him on these points. Tragedy, Comedy, Oratory,
History, Lyric, &amp;c., were established forms. Rhetoric, though
interesting, was almost as scientific as arithmetic or geometry.
As for language, you imitated the best models, and did not play
personal tricks. Besides, it was quite a minor matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, we see that (again half, or more than half, unconsciously
and instinctively) Dante has been brought by the "forward
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>And of comparative criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
flowing tide of time" to a more advanced position in
respect of comparative criticism. No ancient critic
could have made such a survey as he makes of the
different languages of Europe; no ancient critic did make such
a survey of the dialects of Greek as he makes of the dialects
of Italian. That curious spirit of routine which (valuable as it
was in the time and in the circumstances) mars ancient literature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>to some extent, shows itself nowhere more oddly than
here. You used Æolic dialect for lyric poetry, because Sappho
and Alcæus were Æolians; Doric for pastorals, because Theocritus
and the others were Dorians. You might use Ionic
in history because Herodotus was a Halicarnassian; and Homer
preserved a special dialect for you in epic likewise. But otherwise
you wrote in Attic, not because Attic was the Illustrious
Vulgar Tongue of Greece (as it very nearly if not quite was),
but because an enormous proportion of the best writers in most
departments were Athenians. So in Latin you might—almost
must—use loose verse, and familiar or abstruse phrase, in satire,
but not elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of this there is no trace in Dante, though he may allot his
Illustrious tongue to one kind, his Intermediate and Lower to
others. He may indeed cite, as a subsidiary argument, the fact
that such and such a one has used such and such a dialect or
form, but it is only subsidiary. He is, in effect, looking about
to see, partly how the reason of things will go, partly what has
actually had the best effect. He, groping dimly in the benighted,
the shackled Middle Ages, actually attains to a freer and more
enlightened kind of criticism than the Greeks, with all their
“play of mind,” all their “lucidity,” had reached.</p>

<p class='c001'>And his bent towards formal criticism—towards those considerations
of prosody, of harmony, of vocabulary, of structure,
which, when they are considered to-day, even now send some
critics into (as the poet says)</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A beastly froth of rage”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>against those who so consider them—is all the more important,
because not the most impudent accuser of the brethren can
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The poetical differentia according to him.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
bring against Dante the charge of being a mere
formalist, of being indifferent to meaning, of having
no “criticism of life” in him, of lacking “high
seriousness,” attention to conduct, care for meaning
and substance. On the contrary, there is not a poet in the
whole vast range of poetry, not the Greek tragedians at their
gravest and highest chorus-pitch, not Lucretius in his fervour of
Idealist Materialism, not Shakespeare in the profoundest moments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>of Macbeth, or Prospero, or Hamlet, not Milton, not Wordsworth,
who is more passionately ideal, “thoughtful,” penetrated and
intoxicated with the “subject,” than Dante is. But he, thanks
very mainly to the logical training of the despised scholasticism,
thanks partly to the mere progress of time, the refreshing of the
human mind after its season of sleep—most of all no doubt to
his own intense and magnificent poetical genius—had completely
separated and recognised the differentia of poetry, its presentation
of the subject in metrical form with musical accompaniment,
whether of word or of actual music.<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c008'><sup>[578]</sup></a> He knows—he actually says
in effect—that prosemen may have the treatment of the same
subjects; but he knows that the poet’s treatment is different,
and he goes straight for the difference.</p>

<p class='c001'>And where does he find it? Exactly where Wordsworth
five hundred years later refused to find it, in Poetic Diction and
<span class='sni side9'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His antidote to the Wordsworthian heresy.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in Metre. The contrast of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span> and
of the <i>Preface</i> to <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite> is so remarkable
that it may be doubted whether there is any more
remarkable thing of the kind in literature. Whether
Wordsworth was acquainted with the treatise it is impossible to
say. (Coleridge certainly knew of it, though it is not quite clear
whether he had read it.) But it is improbable, for Wordsworth
was not a wide reader. And, moreover, though in
tendency the two tractates are diametrically opposed, he
nowhere answers Dante; but, on the contrary, is answered by
Dante, with an almost uncanny anticipation of the privilege of
the last word, in a word five hundred years earlier.</p>

<p class='c001'>We shall have to return to this matter in dealing with Wordsworth
himself. But for the present let us confine ourselves to
Dante.</p>

<p class='c001'>The details of his metrical part need the lesser notice because
they are of the more limited and particular application.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His handling of metre.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Had Dante completed his book, it would still
have had the limitation of dealing solely with Romance, if not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>exclusively with Italian, poetry. And with particular episodes
we shall only meddle when they are closely connected with
general critical quarrels. But his method is worth a word or
two, because it is again, precisely, that apparently loose but
really unerring mixture of general reasoning and particular
observation which the critic requires, which prevents him from
being ever exactly scientific, but which gives to his craft the
dignity, the difficulty, the versatile charm of art. His recognition
of the hendecasyllable, not merely as the line preferred
by the best writers in Italian, but as the longest line really
manageable in Italian, would be sufficient proof of this.</p>

<p class='c001'>But he is considerably more interesting on diction, because
here his observations (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mutatis mutandis</i></span>, and that in extremely
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Of diction.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
few cases and unimportant measure) are of universal
application. The theory of Poetic Diction, the twin
pillar of the temple of Poetry, had been put by Longinus in one
flashing axiom, true, sound, illuminative for ever and ever. But
he had not elaborated this; he had even, in some cases, as in his
remarks on the Εἰς ἐρωμέναν, given occasion to those who
blaspheme the doctrine. Dante, with no such single phrase
(which indeed the odd mongrel speech he uses denied him),
expresses the doctrine far more fully, elaborates it, establishes
it soundly, and, moreover, is never in the very least inconsistent
with himself about it. Even Aristotle himself would have
joined no direct issue with the quadripartite division of the
necessities of serious poetry as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gravitas sententiæ</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>superbia
carminum</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>constructionis elatio</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>excellentia verborum</i></span>; but he
would have given the first preponderance over all the others,
and would have laid descending stress on the rest. It may
almost be said that Dante exactly reverses the order. The
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gravitas sententiæ</i></span> is not denied, but assumed as a thing of
course, common to all good matter in verse and prose alike. The
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>superbia carminum</i></span> is a matter of investigation; but when you
have got your form of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cantio</i></span>, &amp;c., settled, that <em>is</em> settled. It is
upon the third and the fourth, which are, briefly, Style and
Diction, that he bends his whole strength, and that he exhibits
his most novel, most important, most eternally valid criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been said that the examples, both Latin and Italian,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>produced in the chapter on Style (that is to say, the construction
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His standards of style.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
or arrangement of selected phrase as opposed to
selection of the component words) are not free from
difficulty. But if we examine them all carefully together, something
will emerge from the comparison. In the four Latin
sentences<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c008'><sup>[579]</sup></a> (for translations here are totally useless) we observe
that the first<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c008'><sup>[580]</sup></a> is a mere statement of fact, possessing, indeed,
that complete expression of the meaning which Coleridge so
oddly postulates as the differentia of style, but possessing
nothing more—nourishing, in short, but not “sapid.” The next<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c008'><sup>[581]</sup></a>
is carefully (“tastefully”) arranged according to the scholastic
rules—verb at the end, important words at end or beginning of
clause, &amp;c., but nothing more. The charm (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>venustas</i></span>) of the
third<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c008'><sup>[582]</sup></a> is more difficult to identify; but it would seem to consist
in a sort of superficially rhetorical declamation. But there is
no difficulty in discovering in what the fourth sentence<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c008'><sup>[583]</sup></a> differs
from the rest. There is the conceit of the “casting out of the
flowers” with the interwoven play of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>florum</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Florentia</i></span>, the
apostrophe to the town, the double alliteration of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>florum</i></span>,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Florentia</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Trinacriam</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Totila</i></span>, with the reverse order of length
in the words, and their vowel arrangement. And in almost
all the verse vernacular examples, though it may not always
be easy to discern their exact attraction for Dante, we shall find
the same alliteration—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="oc" xml:lang="oc">“Sols sui qui sai lo sobrafan, que me sortz;”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>the same vowel-music—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="oc" xml:lang="oc">“Dreit Amor qu’ en mon cor repaire;”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>or a combination of this music with careful mounting and
falling rhythm, as in</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="oc" xml:lang="oc">“Si com l’ arbres, que per sobrecarcar.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>In other words, we shall find, in all, devices for making the
common uncommon, for giving the poetic strangeness, unexpectedness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>charm,—by mere arrangement, by arrangement <em>plus</em>
music, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The contempt of style as something “vulgar,” which had
beset all antiquity (save always Longinus), would have alone
prevented the ancients from criticising in this way, even if the
lack of various language had not done so.</p>

<p class='c001'>And so we find, on the threshold, or hardly even on the
threshold, of what is commonly called modern literature, an
anticipation, and more than an anticipation, of what is really
modern criticism. Of course this is a disputable even more
than a disputed statement. Of course there are many respectable
authorities who will not hear of it, who will accuse those
who make it of mere will-worship, perhaps even of gross error,
for assuming any such thing. Yet it may be said in all
humility, but after a very considerable number of years of
study of a subject to which little general attention has been
given, that there <em>is</em> this difference between ancient and modern
criticism, and that it appears in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span>. I
shall be content, I shall even be much obliged, if any one will
point out to me, in the authors who have been hitherto considered,
or in any who may have been overlooked, a passage
like this. I can only say that, in my reading, I have found
none.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the chapter of words—the Chapter of the Sieve, as we
may call it—is that which contains the real heart and kernel
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The "Chapter of the Sieve."</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of Dante’s criticism. For, dwell as much as he may
on the importance of arrangement and phrase, it is
impossible that these should be beautiful without
beautiful words to make them of. And his system of “sifting,”
quaint as its phraseology may seem at first sight, arbitrary as
some of its divisions may appear, and here and there difficult
as it may be exactly to follow him, is a perfectly sound scheme,
and only requires working out at greater length. The objection
to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>puerilia</i></span>, though it may be too sweepingly expressed,
is absolutely just, and cuts away Wordsworth’s childishnesses
by anticipation. That to “effeminate” words, “silvan” words,
words too “slippery” and too much “brushed the wrong way,”
is, in its actual form, perhaps somewhat too closely connected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>with the peculiarities of the Italian language. We can understand
that the snarling sound of the <i>r</i> in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gregia</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>corpo</i></span>—the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>silvestre</i></span> and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>reburrum</i></span>—may have offended the delicate
Italian musical ear; and it is perfectly easy for a pretty well-educated
English one to perceive that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>donna</i></span>, with the ring of the
<i>n</i>’s and the sudden descent—the falcon drop—to <i>a</i>, is a far more
poetical word than <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>femina</i></span>, where, except the termination, there
is no hold for the voice at all; it merely “slips over” the
“lubric” syllables <i>fe</i> and <i>mi</i>. But it is much more difficult
to understand the objection to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dolciada</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>piacevole</i></span> as too
effeminate. Not only is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dolciada</i></span> itself a very charming word
to <em>us</em>, but it is impossible to see anything more effeminate in it
than in many of those which Dante admits and admires.
These things, however, will always happen.</p>

<p class='c001'>The metaphor of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pexa</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>hirsuta</i></span>, odd as it seems, is
not difficult to work out when we have once accepted the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> pexa.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
analogy of hair, for which in itself it would not be
difficult to find a more or less fanciful justification.
The merely “glossy”—smooth, soft, insufficient—will not do,
and those “brushed the wrong way” still less. What is wanted
is <em>natural</em> curl and wave—with light and colour in them, of
course, though not mere gloss. This may be either the result
of careful “combing out” of all tangle and disorder, or it may
be wilder grace, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>hirsutum</i></span>, the “floating hair” of <em>our</em> poet.
Dante’s rigid orthodoxy makes him assign very strict qualification
to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pexa</i></span>. They are to be trisyllabic or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vicinissima</i></span> to

little slur of it, can be made amphibrachic in character. And
why? Because these amphibrachic words help, as no others
can do, to give that trochaic swing, with little intervals between,
which supplies the favourite rhythm of Italian poetry, as in
the very instance given a little later by Dante from his own
poetry—</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>where the rhythm (as opposed to the actual scansion) of the

and leaving the four main trochees to carry the rock of the verse
on their backs. The dislike to aspirates, to double <i>x</i>’s and <i>z</i>’s, to
certain collocations of consonants, &amp;c., is again purely Italian,
though it would not be difficult to assign somewhat similar
qualifications to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pexa</i></span> of other languages.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Dante is far too free and far too opulent a poet to confine
himself, or recommend others to confine themselves, to a mere
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> hirsuta.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
“prunes and prism”—to simple prettiness of precious
words. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>hirsuta</i></span>, the more careless ordered vocabulary,
must be had too sometimes, because you cannot do
without them, as in the case of the monosyllabic particles,
copulatives, and what not, sometimes as dissyllables, and polysyllables,
which will make an ornamental effect by combination
and contrast with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pexa</i></span>. Here, yet once more, there may be
difficulties with the individual cases; it is indeed hard to see
the possibility of beauty, even in the most combed-out company,
of such a word as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>disavventuratissimamente</i></span>: but the
principle is clear and sound. What that principle is we may
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Other critical</i> loci <i>in Dante</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
shortly state when we have given a glance at Dante’s
other and much less important critical utterances,
contained in the undoubtedly genuine <i>Convito</i>, and
in the sometimes, but perhaps captiously, disputed <cite>Letter to Can
Grande</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This last<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c008'><sup>[585]</sup></a>, which, as is well known, sets itself forth as a dedication
of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Paradiso</cite></span> to the Lord of Verona, contains a kind of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Epistle to Can Grande.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
expository criticism by the author of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Commedia</cite></span>
itself. There is nothing in it inconsistent with the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari</cite></span>, but the method is very much more
scholastic and jejune. There are six things to be inquired
about in any serious matter—the subject, the agent, the form,
the end, the title, the kind of philosophy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Paradiso</cite></span> is different from the other two <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>cantiche</i></span> in subject,
form, and title, not in author, end, and philosophic tone.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>The meaning or subject is partly literary, partly allegorical;
the form is duplex—the external by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>cantiche</i></span>, cantos, verses;
while the method or internal form is poetic, figurative, &amp;c.
The title is, “Here beginneth the Comedy of D. A., Florentine
by birth not disposition.” Comedy comes from, &amp;c., tragedy
from, &amp;c. As Comedy begins ill and ends well, we call this
a comedy. It is in the vulgar tongue: its end is evangelic,
its philosophy ethical and practical.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is little to notice here except the poet’s comparative
depreciation of the Vulgar Tongue as “humble and weak,”<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c008'><sup>[586]</sup></a>
but this of course is only said rhetorically.</p>

<p class='c001'>The curious First Book of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Convito</cite></span><a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c008'><sup>[587]</sup></a> not merely contains
the promise of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari</cite></span><a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c008'><sup>[588]</sup></a>, but is a sort of pendent
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Convito.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to it, being an elaborate excuse for writing the
book in the Vulgar tongue itself. Its expressions
are not always in literal agreement with those of the other
treatise; but these differences, even the exaltation of Latin as
“nobler,”<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c008'><sup>[589]</sup></a> in an apparent contradiction to the argument of the
later book, are sufficiently accounted for by the difference of
purpose and subject. But the elaborate apology for writing in
the vernacular, and the elaborate arguments by which it is
supported, have no small critical interest of their own; and
the later chapters contain eager championship of Italian, if
not against Latin, yet against Provençal, which it was the
fashion to compare to it. It is scarcely necessary to go through
this book in detail; but it contains some very interesting glimpses,
and, as it were, <em>vistas</em> of critical truth. The two most noteworthy
of these are the remarks about translation, and those
about the respective advantages for showing a language of
prose and verse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Translation Dante condemns utterly. Nothing harmonised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>by the laws of the Muses can be changed from one tongue to
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dante on Translation.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
another without destroying all its sweetness and
harmony. This (which is arch-true) connects itself
directly with Dante’s unerring direction towards the criticism
of form. If “all depends on the subject,” translation can do
no harm, for the subject can be maintained in exactly the same
condition through more languages than Mezzofanti or Prince
Lucien Bonaparte ever meddled with. But the form, the language,
the charm of the verse, the music of the composition,
<em>they</em> go utterly and inevitably; and even if the translator succeeds
in putting something in their place, it is another, and not
themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, in the eloquent and admirable defence<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c008'><sup>[590]</sup></a> of the tongue
of <i>Si</i> against the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Lingua d’Oco</i></span>, he has this remarkable saying,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>On language as shown in prose and verse.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that you cannot see its real excellence in rhymed
pieces, for the accidental accompaniments (“accidental,”
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quoad</i></span> language). So do the clothes and
jewels of a beautiful woman distract the attention
from her real beauty, as much as this is set forth by them.
In prose the ease, propriety, and sweetness of the language itself
can best be shown. Now, let it be observed that this is no
exaltation of prose above poetry as such—Dante was far too
good a critic, as well as far too great a poet, to make a blunder
which has been made since, though hardly before. His argument
is the perfectly sound, and, unless I mistake, almost
wholly novel one—that the <em>intrinsic</em> powers (if they be doubted)
of a language are best shown in prose. If it can do well there,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a fortiori</i></span> it can do better in poetry; but the “added sweetness”
of rhythm, metre, rhyme, poetic diction, and the like may
distract the attention from the mere and sheer merits of the
language itself. And so once more we find Dante, in opposition
to the Master, in opposition to all ancient critics except
Longinus, and partly even to him, recognising the ultimate and
real test of literary excellence as lying in the expression, not
in the meaning.</p>

<p class='c001'>This would in itself be a thing so great that no greater has
met or will meet us throughout this history. Even yet the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>truth, which Longinus caught but as in a Pisgah-sight, which
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Final remarks on his criticism.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Dante himself rather felt and illustrated throughout
than consciously or deliberately championed in
any particular place—the truth that the criticism
of literature is first of all the criticism of expression as regards
the writer, of impression as regards the reader—is far from being
universally recognised, is far even from being a prevailing or a
popular doctrine. By many it is regarded as an unquestionable
heresy, by others as a questionable half-truth. But that Dante
did feel, if he hardly saw, it, that he was penetrated by it, that
his criticism in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span> turns on it—for these
things I hope to have shown some cause.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not of course (it may, though it should not, be necessary to
repeat this) that he was himself by any means indifferent to the
“subject.” On the contrary, the great threefold division of the
subjects of high poetry into <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Salus</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Venus</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Virtus</i></span>—Arms, Love,
and religiously guided Philosophy—is to this day the best that
exists. And here too Dante has made a notable advance on the
ancients, in admitting Love to equality in principle, to the
primacy (I had almost said), in practice. We saw how the good
Servius found it necessary to apologise for the fourth book of the
Æneid, as dealing with the trifling subject of Love; we know
how Greek criticism slighted Euripides, not, as it might have
done, for his literary shortcomings, but because of his reliance on
the tender passion; we know further how, except in mystical
philosophisings of the Platonic kind, there is nothing satisfactory
on the matter anywhere—that not merely Dionysius but
Longinus, in the very act of preserving for us the two chief love-poems
of the ancient world, can find nothing adequate to say
about them, and that Aristotle leaves the subject severely alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here also Dante knew better; here also he expressed consummately
all the enormous gain of dream which the sleep of the
Dark Ages had poured into the heart and the soul of the world.
But here his service, though critical in category, was hardly
critical in method; and, besides, he was only one of a myriad.
From Brittany to Transylvania, and from Iceland to Provence,
the whole thirteenth century, if not the whole twelfth also, had
been “full of loves”—there had been no fear of “Venus” being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>forgotten. But all these thousand singers had simply sung
because they must or would. They had had no critical thought
of the manner of their singing. If they had written in Latin, it
was because of custom, because they wanted learned appreciation,
because they had been taught to write in Latin. If they
had written in the vernacular, it was because it came naturally
to them, and there was guerdon for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this, as we have seen, was not possible to Dante. Ever a
fighter, he was not content to serve the Illustrious Vernacular,
to write in it, to advance its powers, without arguing for it as well,
without giving it a critical title to place and eminence. Ever a
thinker, too, he was not satisfied to write the best poetry, but
must know how and in what the best poetry consisted, what
made it best, what were its resources and stores of attack and of
charm. Most fortunately, his conviction that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vulgare</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>regulare</i></span>
were two very different things, and that the methods of
treating them must be different also, led him, as it would seem,
to abandon the devices of the regular Rhetoric, and to construct,
half-consciously no doubt, a new and really Higher Rhetoric of
the vulgar tongue itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is what we have systematically, if incompletely, for
Poetics in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>De Vulgari Eloquio</i></span>, while we have hints towards a
prose Rhetoric in the first book of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Banquet</i></span><a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c008'><sup>[591]</sup></a>. And it cannot
be too much insisted on that, in the former case definitely
and systematically, in the latter by sample and suggestion
rather than directly, a kind of criticism is disclosed of which
we hardly find any trace in the ancients (Longinus partly
excepted), though if Aristotle had worked out one side of
his own doctrines, and had been less afraid of Art and its
pleasure, we might have had it from him.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the book itself remained so long unknown, and that
even after its belated publication it attracted little attention,
and has for the most part been misunderstood, or not understood
at all, is no doubt in part connected with the fact of
its extraordinary precocity. On the very threshold of modern
literature, Dante anticipates and follows out methods which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>have not been reached by all, or by many, who have had the
advantage of access to the mighty chambers whereof the house
has since been built and is still a-building.</p>

<p class='c001'>We shall see nothing like this in the rest of the present
Book. Some useful work on Prosody, a little contribution of
the usual Rhetoric, some interesting if indirect critical expression,
will meet us. But no, or next to no, such criticism properly
so called, no such exploration and exposition of the secrets of
the literary craft, no such revelation of the character of the
literary bewitchment.<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c008'><sup>[592]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r547'>547</a>. The choice between <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Eloquentia</i></span> and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Eloquium</i></span> lies with the taste and
fancy of the chooser.  The first word
occurs first in the treatise itself. The
second is in the title of the Grenoble
MS. The texts which I use are, for
the Latin, Dr Prompt’s facsimile of
this MS., Venice, Olschki, 1892, and
Dr Moore’s edition of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Opere</i></span> (Oxford,
1897), with Mr Ferrers-Howell’s
annotated English translation (London,
1890). This latter is very good as a
whole, though of course one may differ
as to the rendering of individual terms.
The edition of the Società Dantesca
by Signor P. Rajna (Florence, 1896) is
elaborated with all the minute care by
which scholarship in the looser modern
vernaculars endeavours to put itself on
a level with that in the older and
exacter tongues. Unfortunately the
emulation, here as elsewhere, is carried
as far as the old unworthy tricks of
depreciation and abuse of predecessors
and rivals. The elaborate commentary
is limited, with an almost ferocious
scrupulosity, to the barest letter of
the text; but another volume containing
literary annotation is promised.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r592'>592</a>. I have not thought it necessary to
devote any space to the consideration
of the relations of Scholastic Philosophy
to  Criticism. To search the whole
literature of Scholasticism for these
would be an enormous labour; and
some slight knowledge of the subject
(to which I once hoped to devote much
of the time and energy actually, but
involuntarily, spent on things less
worthy and less interesting) leads me
to believe that it would be an almost
wholly fruitless one. In Dante and in
Boccaccio (<i>v. infra</i>) we have interesting
examples of the bent which scholastic
education gave to critics. Lully, or
“Lull,” as they call him now (though
he by no means rhymes to “dull”),
shows (<i>v.</i> <a href='#f457'>note, p. 371</a>) how criticism
afar off might strike a schoolman. But
all the men of the schools abode in
mere Rhetoric, and even that they
mostly despised.</p>

third. If it were not part of the scheme of this work
to leave no period of literary history unnoticed in
relation to criticism, a straight stride might almost
be taken from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span> to the earliest of the
momentous and (from some points of view) rather unfortunate
attempts which the Italian critics of the Renaissance made to
bring about an <i>eirenicon</i> between Plato and Aristotle, by sacrificing
the whole direct product, and the whole indirect lesson, of
the Middle Ages. Between Dante and this group of his compatriots
two hundred years later, it is scarcely too much to say
that there is not a single critic or criticism, either in Italy or
in any other European language, possessing substantive importance.
But this book endeavours to be a history, not merely of
explicit literary criticism, but of implicit literary taste; and no
period—not the dimmest gloom of the Dark Ages nor the most
glaring blaze of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Aufklärung</i></span>—is profitless as a subject for
inquiry in that respect, even if the result be little more than
the old stage-direction—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>même jeu</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>In <cite>Arts of Rhetoric</cite>, with or without special or partial reference
to Poetry, the two centuries, especially the fifteenth, are
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The material it offers.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
indeed fairly prolific. Nothing could be more significant
for the subjective side of Critical History than
that gradual and at last undisguised identification of “Rhetoric”
with “Poetry” itself, which is notorious alike in the hackneyed
title of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>grands rhétoriqueurs</i></span> for the French poets of the fifteenth
century, and the continual praise of Chaucer’s “rhetoric” by
the English and Scottish writers of the same time. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sacra
fames</i></span><a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c008'><sup>[593]</sup></a> of the whole two hundred years for Allegory—a hunger
which was not in the least checked by the Renaissance, though
the sauce of what it glutted itself on was somewhat altered—is
another capital fact of the same kind; the renewed passion for
changed kinds of Romance another; the ever-increasing interest
in drama yet another still. These are the real materials for the
student of criticism and taste at this time, and they are identical
with the materials, for this period, of the student of literary
history generally. In the strictly proper matter of our particular
province we not merely may, but had best, confine
ourselves to some short notice of the formal writings of the
period, and some, rather fuller, of the literary opinions expressed
by characteristic exponents of it, whether their claim to represent
be derived from eminence, or from merely average, and
therefore tell-tale, quality.</p>

<p class='c001'>Into the first it will not be necessary to enter at any length.
The formal Latin Arts of Rhetoric of the fourteenth and fifteenth
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The Formal Arts of Rhetoric.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>centuries exhibit nothing new, but observe with a
touching fidelity the lines of Martianus, or Aphthonius,
or Hermogenes, as the case may be. Moreover, such
notice of them as is at all necessary will be better given in
the next Book and volume, in connection with their immediate
successors of the undoubted Renaissance. The chain of merely
formal Rhetoric is unbroken till much later; as it had been
little affected by the change from “Classical” to “Mediæval,” so
it was not sensibly changed till “Renaissance” had definitely
given way to “Modern.” The vernacular <cite>Arts of Poetry</cite> are, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>English of this period, non-existent; and, considering all things,
they are heartily to be congratulated on their wisdom and foresight
in not existing. In Italy they are of little moment, since
Italian poetry had to a great extent taken its line once for all.
In French and in German they both exist, and exhibit considerable
individual quality. But that quality is emphatically for an
age, and not of all time. The growth of the exquisitely graceful
but dangerously artificial French poetry of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Ballade</cite></span> and <cite>Chant
Royal</cite>, of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rondeau</i></span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>triolet</i></span>; the growth of the artificial, but
rarely in the very least graceful, form-torturing of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>meister-singers</i></span>
were both accompanied and followed, as was natural and
indeed inevitable, by abundance of formal directions for executing
the fashionable intricacies. Some of the more noteworthy
of these may be indicated in a note but—as has not always
been, and will not always be the case with similar things—they
require little or no discussion in the text. For the developments
to which they related were not merely a little artificial in the
bad sense, but they were also purely episodic and of the nature
of curiosities. They had not, as even the most apparently preposterous
acrobatics of the Latin rhythmic had, the priceless
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>And of Poetry.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
merit of serving as gymnastic to the new vernaculars—at best
they only continued this gymnastic in the case of
languages that were “grown up.” That they—at
least the French division of them—furnished some exquisite
moulds, into which the purest poetry could be thrown, is perfectly
true. But Jehannot de Lescurel, and Charles d’Orléans,
and Villon most of all, could have, and doubtless would have,
produced that poetry in any form that happened to be popular at
their time. Nay, as has been abundantly shown in France and
England during the last quarter of the nineteenth century and
a little earlier, the forms themselves will fit any poetry of any
time. The ancient names, and the mediæval trimmings, and the
modern sentiment of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Dames du Temps Jadis</cite></span>, are all equally
at home in its consummate but artificial form; and that form is
equally suitable to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Voyage à Cythère</cite></span> and the aspiration for a
grave on the breast of the Windburg. Defect there is none in
this accommodating character: rather there is a great quality.
But, in the special kind of merit, there is a differentiation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>from such things as the Greek chorus, the Latin elegiac, the
Mediæval rhythmus, the mono-rhymed or single-assonanced
<em>tirade</em>, the Spenserian, even the eighteenth-century, couplet,
which carry their atmosphere and their time inseparably with
them. And so we may turn to our testings of writers in whom
the criticism “is not so expressed,” but who are not the less
valuable to us for that.</p>

<p class='c001'>Are we to regret, or not, that Chaucer did not leave us an <cite>Art
of Rhetoric</cite> instead of a <cite>Treatise on the Astrolabe</cite>? Probably not.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Examples of Indirect Criticism: Chaucer.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He would hardly have felt what is called in religious
slang “freedom” to say what he undoubtedly
might have said on Applied Rhetoric and on
Pure Rhetoric, though it would have been very
agreeable to hear him. He would probably not have told us
anything new. In any kind of formal writing he would probably
have displayed that not in the least irrational orthodoxy
which he displays on most subjects. But there is perhaps no
writer—at least no writer of anything approaching his greatness—who,
abstaining from deliberate and expressed critical work,
has left us such acute and unmistakable critical byplay, such
escapes of the critical spirit. If the sly hit at his namesake of
Vinsauf, which has been already glanced at<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c008'><sup>[594]</sup></a>, stood alone, it would
show us “what a <em>critic</em> was in Chaucer lost”—at least to the extent
of lying <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>perdu</i></span> for the most part. But this is not the only
example of the kind by any means, even in apparent chance-medleys:
while in the <cite>Rhyme of Sir Thopas</cite><a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c008'><sup>[595]</sup></a> we have what is
almost a criticism in form, and what certainly displays more
critical power than ninety-nine out of a hundred criticisms
in fact.</p>

<p class='c001'>That this celebrated and agreeable fantasy-piece is in any
sense an onslaught on Romance, as Romance, is so fond a thing
that it is sufficient to discredit the imaginations, or the intelligence,
of those who entertain it. Dulness never will understand,
either that those who are not dull can laugh at what they
love, or that it is possible for a man to see faults, and even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>serious faults, in writers and writings on whom and on which,
as wholes, he bestows the heartiest admiration. From the outset
of his career the critic has to make up his mind to be
charged with “ungenerous,” or “grudging,” or “not cordial”
treatment of those whom he loves with a love that twenty
thousand of his accusers could not by clubbing together equal,
and understands with an understanding of which—not of course
by their own fault but by that of Providence—they are simply
incapable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of this touch of foolish nature the inference from <cite>Sir Thopas</cite>
that Chaucer disliked, or despised, or failed to sympathise with,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sir Thopas.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Romance, is one of the capital instances. To remember
that the author of the <cite>Rhyme</cite> was also the author
of the <cite>Knight’s Tale</cite>, and the <cite>Squire’s Tale</cite>, and <cite>Troilus</cite>, that he
was the translator of the <cite>Romance of the Rose</cite>, might of itself
suffice to keep the wayfaring man straight in this matter; but
those who can understand what they read have not the slightest
need of such a memory. There have been parodies<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c008'><sup>[596]</sup></a> of Romance
which incurred the curse of blasphemy: there is one in
particular, not very many years old, which, in the energetic and
accurate language of Mr Philip Pirrip, “must excite Loathing in
every respectable mind.” But <cite>Sir Thopas</cite>, even to those who
have not read many of its originals and victims, much more to
those who are well acquainted with them, and who rejoice in
them exceedingly and unceasingly, can never put on any such
complexion. The intense good-humour and the absolutely unruffled
play of intelligence, the complete freedom from (what
appears for instance capitally in the example just glanced at)
political, national, social <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>animus</i></span>, and the almost miraculous
fashion in which the caricature strikes at the corruptions, but
never at the essential character, of the thing caricatured, settle
this once for all.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we knew (as unluckily we do <em>not</em> know) whether the Host
and the company stopped <cite>Sir Thopas</cite> because they disliked the
type, or because the example was a parody, it would be a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>help to us; but it is scarcely a less help to perceive clearly that
its critical character would have been enough to put them out of
conceit with it. Few people really do like criticism; fewer still
like real criticism. And the criticism of <cite>Sir Thopas</cite>, though
disguised, is very real. Everybody, whether he knows the
metrical romances of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
or not, can see the joke of the seemly nose; the far country
of Flanders; the rebuke to the maidens, who had much better
have been sleeping quietly than fussing about the beautiful
knight; the calm decision of that knight that an elf-queen—nobody
less—must be the object of his affections; the
terrible wilderness, where buck and hare ramp and roar, and
seek whom they may devour; the extraordinarily heroic exertions,
which consist merely in pumping the unhappy steed;
the fair bearing, which consists in running away with celerity
and success. But nobody who does not know the romances
themselves in their weakest examples, such as <cite>Sir Eglamour</cite>
or <cite>Torrent of Portugal</cite>, can fully appreciate the manner in
which the parody is adjusted to the original. Not the deftest
and most disinterested critic of any day could single out, by
explicit criticism, the faults “before the Eternal” of the feebler
and more cut-and-dried romance, more clearly or more accurately
than Chaucer has, by example, in this tale. The stock epithet
and phrase; the stock comparison; the catalogue (he had himself
indulged pretty freely in the catalogue); the pound of
description to an ounce of incident; the mixture of the
hackneyed and the ineffective in the incident itself,—all
these things this mercilessly candid friend, this maliciously
expert practitioner, exposes with the precision of an Aristotle
and the zest of a Lucian.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet the whole is done by implication and unexpounded
example, not in the very least by direct criticism. Had it
occurred to him, or pleased him, he could no doubt have censured
all these faults in as businesslike and direct a manner as
his Parson (or rather his Parson’s original) censures the moral,
social, and fashionable shortcomings of the age. But he certainly
did not do this, and probably he never thought of
doing it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>Cross the Channel (though indeed it was not always necessary to
do this) and take Chaucer’s greatest contemporary among French
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Froissart.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span> writing men. It has been said, by that very agreeable
biographer of Froissart whom England (mindful
of his early loyalty, and characteristically neglectful of his later
infidelity) lent to France, that he “was not a man of letters.”<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c008'><sup>[597]</sup></a>
It may be so: but if it be, he was certainly one of the most
literary not-men-of-letters that the world has ever seen. Not
only is he admittedly one of that world’s most charming prose-writers,
but it has long been known that the notion of him (if
it ever existed among the intelligent) as of a good garrulous old
person who wrote as the birds sing, is utterly erroneous. At
one time he could make a mosaic of borrowed and original
writing—the borrowings often in the very words of the original,
the original adjusted to them with an art that nobody but
Malory has ever approached, and that even Malory shows rather
in general management than in style. At another, and at another
again, he could, whether with or against the grain, laboriously
recast this mosaic into the most widely different forms.
His very desultoriness is calculated; he is criticising the
romances by imitation when he makes a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chassé-croisé</i></span> to the
story of Orthon from the victory of Aljubarrota, from the battle
of Otterburn to the evil receipt for a green wound adopted by
Geoffrey Tête-Noire, and the remarkably sensible, just, kindly,
and gentlemanly remarks of that dying brigand to his fellow-outlaws.</p>

<p class='c001'>But he is not a man of prose letters only. He is a poet, to
the tune of some thirty thousand verses in the long-lost and
late-won <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Méliador</cite></span> alone, to the tune of, I suppose, about as
many more in his familiar, or at least long accessible, minor
poems. He is deft at all the intricate popular forms of the
day—at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pastourelles</i></span> as at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chansons royaux</i></span>, at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>virelais</i></span> as at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rondelets</i></span>. He possesses its learning; and can not only appeal
to the common tales of Troy and Thebes and Alexander, not
only refer to ancient mythology with the semi-pagan docility
which long puzzled students, and seems to puzzle some still,
but be even at home with Enclimpostair, and Pynoteus, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>Neptisphelè. In a certain sense he is a man of letters, a man
of books, all his life, and very much more than Chaucer is.
With all his patronisings by great people and his sojourns
among them, he is nothing like the man of affairs that
Master Geoffrey was.</p>

<p class='c001'>And yet, in a sense also, Madame Darmesteter’s phrase is
intelligible and almost justifiable. It is indeed hardly fair to
base this construction on his scanty and not in the least literary
reference to Chaucer, whom he does not even, like Eustache
Deschamps<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c008'><sup>[598]</sup></a>, call a great translator. In Froissart’s happy
early English time Chaucer had done probably little work, and
certainly none of his best: in that melancholy revisiting, no
more of the blaze of the sun of Cressy and Poitiers, but of the
glimpses of the moon that was to set in blood at Pontefract,
he was probably too old and too disgusted to make inquiries
about such matters. But the absence of the strictly literary
interest in one who not merely had so much literary genius, but
was so constantly reading and writing, is pervading and incessant.
This interest is absent not merely where it might well
have been present, but where its presence seems almost indispensable.
Froissart’s style of poetry invites the widest, and
(except that it is rather too methodical, not to say mechanical)
the wildest, liberty of divagation, of dragging in anything that
really interested him. In the most recondite allegorising of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Prison Amoureuse</cite></span> he expostulates<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c008'><sup>[599]</sup></a> with Desire for not coming
to his aid, and giving him the victory, by the same sort of clever
outflanking attack as that which Chandos executed at the
Battle of Auray, and of which he kindly gives some details.
He names books in the usual manner of Romance; he will go
so far as to praise them; but he never discusses them. In the
well-known passage<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c008'><sup>[600]</sup></a> of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Espinette Amoureuse</cite></span>, when he asks
his beloved the name of the romance she is reading, she does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>indeed tell him that it is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Cléomadès</cite></span> (Did he mention the same
to Chaucer?), with the commendation that it is “well made and
dittied amorously,” and she asks him to lend her another (it is
the <cite>Bailiff of Love</cite><a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c008'><sup>[601]</sup></a> that he hits upon),</p>

<p class='c021'>But, though the comparing of critical opinions on literature
has been not unknown as one of the primrose paths of the
garden of Flirtation, they seem to have trodden it no farther.</p>

<p class='c001'>So in his prose. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>satura</i></span> of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Chroniques</cite></span> admits anything
that interested either Froissart or the men of his time.
In those strange midnight sessions of the Italianate Gascon
Count of Foix—the lettered tyrant-sorcerer who would have
been even more at home in Ferrara or Rimini than in
Béarn—books were in great request; but nobody seems to have
talked criticism. “So much the better for the Bearnese,” the
reader may say; and he is welcome to an opinion which, at
times, if not always, most people must have shared. But that
is not the question. The question is, “Was this a critical
age?” and the answer is, “If it had been, a man could not have
been so bookish as Froissart was and yet be not critical in the
least.” Nor could he, even if some private idiosyncrasy had
accounted for his own attitude, have failed to reveal the
presence of a different one in the time which he has drawn for
us, more poetically no doubt than Boswell or Pepys, but with
not a little of their unpremeditated, their even unconscious,
fidelity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lesson taught by the two men, who occupy the summits
of European literature at the very midmost of the period of this
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Richard of Bury.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
chapter, will be confirmed whether we look earlier
or later. It might seem almost impossible that the
somewhat famous <cite>Philobiblon</cite><a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c008'><sup>[602]</sup></a> of Richard of Bury (or Aungervyle),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>who made one of the greatest collections of books in the
early part of the fourteenth century, and celebrated it in this
little tract just before his own death and shortly after Chaucer’s
probable birth, should not contribute something—improbable that
it should not contribute very much—to our subject. As a matter
of fact it contributes nothing at all. Almost the oldest Sacred
Book (as distinguished from “sacred passages” in Cicero and
others) of Bibliophily, it remains entirely outside of literary
criticism. The good Bishop of Durham, indeed, does not devour
all books with indiscriminating voracity. He is true to his
order in candidly avowing no high opinion of law-books; but
his reason—that they belong rather to Will than to Wit—shows
us his point of view. From that point of view one book may
be preferable to another, as being more useful, as dealing with a
nobler subject, as boasting a more venerable authorship, as
being perhaps rarer, more beautifully written or bound, older,
newer, in better condition, but not, I think, at all as being better
literature. The pleasant garrulity of the tractate; its agreeable
onslaught upon woman, the natural enemy of books; its anecdotage;
its keen sympathy with the Book as almost a living
thing, and certainly one exposed to almost all the dangers of
life, have made it, and will long make it, a favourite. It is
sweet and pleasant: but it is not criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>The author of the <cite>Philobiblon</cite> was a friend of Petrarch’s, and
it may at first sight seem strange that Petrarch himself should
<span class='sni side4'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Petrarch.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
not be—should not indeed have been at the very
beginning or this chapter—summoned to give evidence
likewise. But the fact is that Petrarch has nothing to
tell us in our context. He has indeed, as has been pretty universally
recognised, nothing to do with the Middle Ages. Not
only in his heart and desires, but in his nature, he is a man of
the early—if of the earliest—Renaissance. Even in the vernacular
he rings false as an exponent of anything mediæval.
Timotheus, not St Cecily, has taught his strains. And in his
“regular” writing he is severely, almost ludicrously, a classicaster.
We may return to him as the earliest distinguished
example of the Renaissance attitude; here he cannot even, as
others have done, help us by his silence.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>It is otherwise with his great contemporary, and at the last
friend, Boccaccio. Boccaccio likewise has been claimed as a
prophet of the Renaissance, as one of the first of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Boccaccio.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
moderns and the like; nor would it skill to deny
that there is much both of the Renaissance and of the modern
spirit in him. But he has not broken with the immediate past;
he is only tinging it, and blending it a little, with the farther
past and the future. If something of the magical charm of the
mediæval prose story is gone from the <cite>Decameron</cite>, the learned
voluptuousness of the Renaissance <cite>conte</cite> is not yet <a id='corr457.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='there'>there.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_457.11'><ins class='correction' title='there'>there.</ins></a></span> The
<cite>Filostrato</cite>, and the <cite>Filocopo</cite><a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c008'><sup>[603]</sup></a>, and the <cite>Teseide</cite>, are still romances.
And in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Genealogia Deorum</cite></span>, if there is much of that non-mediæval
spirit which was always in Italy, and not a little of
the Renaissance proper, there is enough of the Middle Age itself
to give it a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>locus standi</i></span> here.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, by a recent authority of great eminence<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c008'><sup>[604]</sup></a> Boccaccio
has been treated as a coryphæus and representative of “the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>His work on Dante.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
critics of the middle ages.” I have endeavoured, in
these chapters, to show that the critics of the middle
ages are, except in the most remote and shadowy function,
almost a non-existent body. And it seems to me that Boccaccio’s
views on criticism, though most worthy of remark, are
the very head and front of that Renaissance side of him which
is so undeniable. In the passage which Mr Courthope cites
from the <cite>Life of Dante</cite>, where Boccaccio says that Theology and
poetry are almost one, that “Theology is God’s poetry,” that it
is a kind of poetic invention when Christ is spoken of at one time
as a lion, at the other as a lamb, that the words of the Saviour
in the Gospel are merely or mainly allegory, that “Poetry is
Theology and Theology poetry,” and that Aristotle said nearly
as much<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c008'><sup>[605]</sup></a>—when he writes in this way he is speaking very
much less the mind of the Middle Ages than the mind which
agitated the mass of his countrymen, the Italian critics, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>Daniello onwards in the sixteenth century. But it is quite
certain that in writing this he is writing with a conception of
criticism quite alien from that which we are now handling.
He may quote Aristotle, but he is speaking in the manner of
Plato. It is poetry in the abstract with which he is dealing,
not the literary value of poetry according to its expression in
form, of no matter what ideal in essence. And it will be found,
I think, that a careful study of his commentary on Dante, the
most important thing of the kind that we possess by one
considerable man of letters in the Middle Ages upon another,
entirely bears this out.</p>

<p class='c001'>As for the <cite>Life</cite> (or, as he himself seems to call it in the first
lecture of the <cite>Commentary</cite>, the “Little Treatise”<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c008'><sup>[606]</sup></a>) on Dante, it
is couched in so extremely rhetorical a style, with constant bursts
of apostrophe and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>epiphonema</i></span>, that there may seem to be a sort
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Trattatello.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
of warning on it from the first: “Criticism not to be
expected.” As a matter of fact, however, Boccaccio
does give us some of what, as we shall see more fully in a
moment, he thought to be criticism, and of what not a few
persons seem still to think the best criticism. For he has an
elaborate digression on Poetry and Poets in the abstract, with
a particular parallel distinction (referred to above) between
poetry and theology. But he goes no farther, and the heading
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Qualità e diffetti di Dante”</span> is entirely occupied with moral
characteristics. In the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Comento</i></span> itself, however, it might well
seem to be a case of Now or Never. Here was a literary
lectureship expressly instituted for the treatment of the greatest
man of letters of the city, the country, and (as it happened) the
world, at the time and for long before and after. Here was an
exceedingly learned lecturer, with plenty of mother-wit to keep
his learning alive, with a distinct fellow-feeling of creation
further to animate both, and with the sincerest and heartiest
goodwill to complete his competence. He spares no trouble,
but goes to his work with scholastic minuteness, expending
some three score lectures and some nine hundred pages on
seventeen cantos only out of the hundred of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Commedia</i></span>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>Unfortunately neither his models nor his tastes seem to incline
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>The</i> Comento.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
him in the way where we would so fain see him
go. He has read Servius and all (or at least many
of) the rhetoricians and scholastic philosophers, and he tells us
with gusto what are the causes, formal, efficient, material, and
final, of the book, how its form is “poetic, fictive, descriptive,
digressive, and transitive,” and how the efficient cause is “that
very same author, Dante Alighieri, of whom we will speak more
extensively by-and-by.” He has also read Fulgentius:<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c008'><sup>[607]</sup></a> and
before very long he gives us a capital specimen of derivation,
in the manner of that ingenious author, by telling us that
“Avernus” is from <i>a</i>, which is without, and <i>vernus</i>, which is
joy. He has at his command all that extraordinary supply of
mythological and miscellaneous classical learning which, as we
shall see immediately, enabled him to write his <cite>Genealogy</cite>: and
he never comes to the name of an ancient writer or of a mythological
personage without giving a full and particular account
thereof. No details are too obvious or too minute for him, even
apart from the allegorical interpretation, in which, as any scholar
of Fabius Planciades, and indeed any mediæval writer of the
fourteenth century, was bound to do, he expatiates delightedly.
He vouches the information that Dante called the forest <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>selvaggia</i></span>
“because he wished to denote that there was not in it any human
habitation, and that as a consequence it was horrible;” <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>aspera</i></span>,
“in order to demonstrate the quality of the trees and shrubs of
the same, which would be old, with long straggling branches
en woven and interpleached among themselves, and likewise full
of blackthorns, and brambles, and dry stubs, growing without
any order, and stretching hither and thither—whereby it was
a rough thing and a dangerous to go through,” &amp;c. He is
copious in moral <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>excursus</i></span> on the impropriety of Florentine
dress, on the sin of Luxury, on the obvious inconvenience
and hardship of the fact that while men are allowed to try
horses, asses, oxen, dogs, clothing, casks, pitchers before they
buy them, they have to take their wives on trust and without
trial. But on literary criticism we come not seldom, but never,
beyond the beggarly elements of verbal interpretation, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>Boccaccio is just as happy with <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Pape Satan</i></span> as with <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Galeotto fu
il libro</i></span>, or rather more so, while he is much happier with
Penthesilea or Pasiphae than with either. It is no doubt unfair
to try Master John Bochas with the things that make us
“nearly wild” (as Cowper made Miss Marianne Dashwood,<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c008'><sup>[608]</sup></a> and
does <em>not</em> often make us), but still the Galeotto passage is very
tempting. Lancelot, we learn, was one of whom the French
romances tell many beautiful and laudable things (things which
he tells us, in confidence, he himself believes to be set forth
rather to please than according to the truth), and the said
Lancelot was <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ferventissimamente</i></span> enamoured of Guinevere.
Then he points out that the line which follows (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Soli eravamo</i></span>,
&amp;c.), and the previous mention of the book, indicate three things—reading
about love, solitude, and freedom from suspicion—which
are very powerful to induce a man and a woman to
adoperate dishonestly. And so he proceeds, expounding or
construing the whole ineffable passage, word for word, with a
solemn and indiscriminate enjoyment—the trembling at the
kiss, the fact that Galehault was a kind of giant, great and big,
down to <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Quel giorno</i></span>, his remark on which, though not scientifically
inaccurate, savours rather of the <cite>Decameron</cite> than of
the <cite>Commedia</cite> itself. But in the whole comment there is
nothing (or, what is worse than nothing, a single banal <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ottimamente
descrive</i></span>) for any part whatsoever of the passion, the
poetry, the mysterious magnificence of the expression. The
passage is to Boccaccio a good <i>ecphrasis</i>, a capital <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>compte rendu</i></span>
of an interesting situation—that is all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Genealogia Deorum</cite></span>.</div>

<p class='c001'>Nor will this be less borne out by an examination of Boccaccio’s
principal “place” of criticism, which will be, perhaps
somewhat unexpectedly, found in the two last books,
the fourteenth and fifteenth, of that singular monument
of learning, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Genealogia Deorum</cite></span>.<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c008'><sup>[609]</sup></a> After laboriously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>searching out all the mythological stories of antiquity within
his reach, and co-ordinating them into a regular family history,
from Demogorgon, through Erebus and his twenty-one sons and
daughters by Night, to Alexander and Scipio (whom, however,
he declines, as a strict genealogist, to admit as sons of Jove),
Boccaccio, at the beginning of his fourteenth book, takes up
the cudgels for Poetry against her enemies. The style is
decidedly rhetorical, and faint remembrances of Clodius as
an accuser (or, to be less pedantic and less hackneyed, of
Steenie lecturing on the turpitude of incontinence) may possibly
occur, as we find the author of the <cite>Decameron</cite> indignantly
denouncing those who sneer at poets and learned men, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>meretriculis
gannientes</i></span>, and holding cups of foaming wine in their
hands. But he is perfectly serious: if a man has not proved
his seriousness by writing a Latin genealogy of the gods in four
hundred large and closely printed folio pages, what is Proof?
There was always, he says, a quarrel between Learning and
Licentiousness. Even some graver folk sneer at, or find fault
with, poetry. Lawyers do so: and the lawyers are properly
rebuked and bid to look at the example of Cicero. Monks do:
and there is expostulation likewise with them. But he will
attack the question in form. Poetry is a noble and useful
thing. Its meaning, its antiquity, its origin are discussed.
There is nothing wrong or harmful in a “fable” as such; but
in all its kinds it can be made of positive utility. Poets do not
retire into solitude out of any misanthropy or wrong motive,
but simply for the sake of meditation: and they have often
been the friends of most respectable people—Ennius of the
Scipios, Virgil of Augustus, Dante of King Frederick and Can
de la Scala, Francis Petrarch of the Emperor Charles, of King
John of France, of King Robert of Jerusalem and Sicily, and of
any number of Popes.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, some say, poetry is obscure. It is certainly written for
the learned and people of wit, not for the common herd; but it
is none the worse for that. It is entirely false that poets are
liars: poetry and lying are two quite different things (Virgil is
here particularly cleared in the matter of Dido). It is foolish
to condemn what you do not understand: and this is generally
done by those who abuse poetry. And it is intolerable that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>men should speak against Homer, Hesiod, Virgil, Horace,
Juvenal, when they have hardly read them. The “seduction”
of Poetry is all nonsense: and the accusation that poetry is the
ape of philosophy, greater nonsense still. It would be better
to call poets the apes of Nature.<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c008'><sup>[610]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>He does not fear to contest the authority of Jerome when he
said that verses were <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Dæmonum cibus</i></span>, of Plato himself, and of
Boethius when he called the Muses “scenic meretricules.” He
grapples with the two first at great length, and points out that
Boethius was thinking chiefly of the naughty theatre. An
allocution to the King (Hugh of Cyprus and Jerusalem), to
whom the whole treatise is dedicated, and a milder deprecation
to the enemies of poetry, conclude this book.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Fifteenth at first seems to launch out into still deeper
waters. You must not insist too much on <em>use</em>. What is the
use of the beard? Yet men of a certain age are ashamed to be
beardless. And as for the duration of work, that is in the
hand of God. But this turns to a mere excuse of his own
actual book. His work has been done as well as he can do it,
both for matter and for style. He refers to divers living or
recent authors, Dante and Petrarch among them, of whom he
gives little descriptions that raise, but hardly satisfy, our curiosity
to see whether he will really criticise. Dante was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>peritissimus
circa poeticam</i></span>, and what he was is shown by his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inclytum opus</i></span>,
“which he wrote with wonderful art, under the title of a Comedy,
in rhyme of the Florentine idiom, and in which he certainly
showed himself not a mythologer but rather a catholic and
divine Theologian. And while he is known to almost all the
world, I know not whether the fame of his name has come
to your latitude.” Petrarch is dealt with much more fully.
“Even that remote corner of the earth England knows him as a
principal poet,”<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c008'><sup>[611]</sup></a> and here Boccaccio no longer <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nescit utrum</i></span>, but
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>haud dubitat quin</i></span>, his fame has reached Cyprus. His “divine”
<cite>Africa</cite>, his Bucolics, his Epistles in verse and prose, and a good
many other things, are noticed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>Next he recurs to antiquity, mentioning Homer especially,
and defending his own practice of mixing Greek words with
Latin by the examples of Cicero, Macrobius, Apuleius, and
Ausonius. He has a good deal to say (entirely in a Renaissance
spirit) on the importance of the Greeks and of Greek; defends,
against clerical prejudice, his description of the heathen poets
as the theologians of mythology, argues once more that Dante
may be called a theologian proper, contends at great length that
there is no harm in the study of heathen matters by Christians,
and, after purging himself of other objections, concludes.</p>

<p class='c001'>A most interesting document; indeed a document upon
which, with reference both to its general tenor and to individual
expressions (of which it has been possible to mention but one
or two here), it would be pleasant to spend much more time.
But a document which, for our present purpose and plan,
seems to establish in the main two things, both of them
rather negative than positive. The first is that Boccaccio can
hardly be appealed to either as helping Dantes Aligerus to
remove the reproach from mediæval criticism, in the sense in
which we here understand it, or even as a representative
proper of mediæval criticism at all—that his criticism, such
as it is, is of a purely Renaissance type, and results, not from
the application of mediæval ideas to ancient matter, but from
the application of resuscitated ancient ideas to matter which,
though not wholly, is preferably chosen from ancient material.
It is not to be forgotten that even in that creative work which
has been referred to above, Boccaccio has always preferred
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>matière de Rome</i></span>, the classical side of the mediæval storehouse.
From this he has drawn the <cite>Teseide</cite>, from this the
<cite>Filostrato</cite>, and if in the <cite>Filocopo</cite> he has made a more purely
mediæval choice, let it be remembered that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Floire et Blanche-fleur</cite></span>,
his original, is of all Romances the most like a Byzantine
novel, and has even been thought to have been directly inspired
by one.</p>

<p class='c001'>Secondly, when we examine the character of this criticism
of his in detail, we find it differing from Dante’s in this, that
while Dante undoubtedly does consider the general and abstract
points of poetry and of literature, Boccaccio practically considers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>nothing else. His descriptions of Dante himself and
of Petrarch would suffice to prove this: but, in fact, it is
proved by every page, every paragraph, every sentence, almost
every word. Throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth books
of the <cite>Genealogy</cite> Boccaccio is really pleading <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro domo sua</i></span>—for
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>status</i></span> and craft of the story-teller generally, not of
the poet as such. And further, he is pleading for free trade
in the story, not for any special process of art or craft in
its manufacture. He had possibly, if not certainly, read the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari</cite></span>, but, as he read it, it must have been in the first
part of the first book only that he found much that was
germane to his own tastes and principles. If we could but
have had from himself such an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>examen</i></span> of the <cite>Decameron</cite> as
Corneille and, still more, Dryden have given of their work!
But the time simply did not admit of any such thing: and
though Boccaccio was very much in advance of his time in
some ways, these ways were not of the some.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor does the Fifteenth Century proper necessitate any revision
of the general doctrine of this chapter. There are here and
there blind stirrings of the Renaissance spirit; but, once more,
they do not concern us. There is everywhere the dogged or
unconscious adherence to the uncritical promiscuousness of the
past; and that has been sufficiently commented upon. If it
be, as perhaps it is, desirable to take a single example, and
deal with it as we have dealt with others, there can hardly
be a better than Gavin Douglas, who at the very end of the
period shows, side by side with Renaissance tendency (which
certainly exists, though to me it does not seem so great as
it has seemed to some), the strongest symptoms of persistent
mediævalism.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nobody can deny that the good Bishop of Dunkeld (uneasiest
to him of bishop-stools!) not only would have liked to be a
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Gavin Douglas.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
critic, but shows both his critical and his Renaissance
sides in the well-known and violent
onslaught on poor Caxton in the first of the very agreeable Prologues
to his own translation of the <cite>Æneid</cite>. In fact, those to
whom the woman who killed Abimelech with a stone or slate
is the patron saint of criticism, must regard him as a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>considerable critic. How Caxton’s work and Virgil’s are “no
more like than the Devil and Saint Austin”; how the author
“shamefully perverted” the story; how the critic read it
“with harms at his heart” that such a book “without
sentence or engine” should be entitled after so divine a bard;
how such a wight never knew three words of what Virgil
meant; how he, Gavin, is “constrained to flyte,”—all this is
extremely familiar. We seem to hear the very voice of the
modern “jacket-duster,” of the man who finds his pet task
anticipated, his pet subject trespassed upon, and is determined
to make the varlet pay for it. Douglas, to be sure, is not
quite in the worst case of this class of critic. He can render
some reasons, neither garbled nor forged, for his censure.
He has (and this is a sign that criticism was stirring) lost
taste for, lost even comprehension of, the full, guileless,
innocent, mediæval licence of suppression, suggestion, and
digression. He protests (quite truly) that Neptune did not
join with Æolus in causing the storm that endangered
Æneas, but on the contrary stilled that storm. He is
indignant at the extension given to the true romantic part
of the poem, the Tragedy of Carthage in the Fourth Book, and
only less indignant at the suppression of the “lusty games” and
plays palustral in the Fifth. Most of all does he tell us of that
aggravation of the critical misuse of allegory which was to be
one of the main Renaissance notes. The “hidden meaning” of
poetry is the great thing for Douglas, and he has much to say
about it before he “turns again” on Caxton. Will it be believed
that Caxton wrote "Touyr for Tiber"! Alas! alas!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For Touyr divides Greece from Hungarie,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Tiber is chief fluide of Italy.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>But all this, and a great deal more like it, as the setting up
of the old Rhetoric-Poetic theory of a poem as the story of a
perfectly noble character, and the rebuke even to Chaucer not
merely for being too literal, just as Caxton was too loose, but
for actually saying (the more Chaucer he!) that Æneas was <em>not</em>
a perfectly noble character but a forsworn traitor,—all this
argues no real relinquishment of the mediæval ideal except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>in a special case. Douglas shows in his own work that he is
after all a chip of the old block, and not fresh hewn from a
virgin quarry.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Prologue to the Sixth Book he returns to the allegorical-philosophical
interpretation of Virgil, and shows himself a
hundred leagues to leeward of the critical port by urging, in
Virgil’s favour, that St Augustine is always quoting him against
Paganism. Not in the whole range of mediæval literature is
that pell-mell cataloguing, which, with more truth than reverence,
has been assimilated to that of the “Groves of Blarney,”
better shown than in the <cite>Palice of Honour</cite>. Solomon, “the well
of sapience,” Aristotle, “fulfillit of prudence,” “Salust, Seneca,
and Titus Livius” jostle Pythagoras and Porphyry, Parmenides
and “Melysses,” “Sidrach, Secundus, and Solenius,” “Empedocles,
<cite>Neptanabus</cite>, and Hermes,” “wise Josephus and facund
Cicero,” with other miraculous couples and trinities. The procession
of the Court of Venus huddles classical, Biblical, and
mediæval in the same, but a more pardonable, fashion; and
when the Muses intervene to save the peccant poet, Dictys
and Dares still march unblushingly with Homer and Virgil.
“Plautus, Poggius, and Persius” must have looked only less
oddly, the first and last at the second, than “Esop, Cato, and
Allane” (Alanus de Insulis of the <cite>Anti-Claudianus</cite> and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De
planetu Naturæ</cite></span>) each at other. Such a capital phrase as
“the mixt and subtle Martial,” the valuable naming of contemporary
poets that follows, and other things, may much more
than atone for, but cannot hide, the higgledy-piggledy character
of the cataloguing, or the odd repetition of the same thing with
a difference at the end of the Second Part, and the yet further
development in the Third. The note of criticism is discrimination—the
note of the Middle Age, as of this, almost its latest exponent,
save in the few places where he has chipped his shell,
is the indiscriminate.</p>

<p class='c001'>It can scarcely be necessary, though it might not be uninteresting,
to take any more examples. We need not
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Further examples unnecessary.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
wander in Hercynian forests with those rules of latest
Middle High German poetry, which have all the
formality of the French “Arts” and none of the charm of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>products. The Marquis of Santillana and his comrades, in
castle or convent of Spain, concern national rather than general
history, history of literature rather than history of criticism;
and they, like others, will best be glanced at retrospectively in
the Renaissance section. From the French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rhétoriqueur</i></span> period
we might pick out much that would illustrate, over and over
again, what has been sufficiently illustrated already, little that
would give us anything new, nothing or next to nothing that
would be at once new and important.<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c008'><sup>[612]</sup></a> As will be shown, a little
more in detail, in the Interchapter which follows, the service
which the Middle Ages rendered to Criticism was indeed inestimable;
but it was by way of provision of fresh material, not
by way of examination, either of that material or of anything
older.</p>

omission—which I know will be deplored
by some, and which I daresay
will be denounced by others—that of
any notice of rhetorical and metrical
writings in the Celtic and Scandinavian
languages. I shall very frankly
acknowledge that there is another
reason for this omission. I have the
greatest dislike to writing about anything
at second-hand; and while I have
as yet had time to acquire only a slight
knowledge of Icelandic, I do not know
anything at all of the Celtic languages.
With the help of Fors Fortuna, I may be
yet able to make these defects in some
measure good; but I do not think it
necessary to delay the present volume
indefinitely in order to do so. “There
is no staying,” as Johnson says, “for
the concurrence of all conveniences.
We will do as well as we can.” So far
as I have been able to inform myself,
the rhetorical writing of Icelandic is
not extensive or important, even though
some may have come from the interesting
hand of Snorri Sturluson. The
early Irish metrical treatises are, no
doubt, of great importance for the
history of metre. But being purely
particularist, and out of the general
current of European literature, their
critical importance can hardly be regarded
as of the highest kind. And
Welsh, while anything of the sort in it
must be much later, is necessarily in
the same position.</p>

CRITICISM.</p>

<p class='c028'>§ II. THE POSITION, ACTUAL AND POSSIBLE, OF LITERARY CRITICISM
AT THE RENAISSANCE.</p>

<h4 class='c029'>I.</h4>

<p class='c021'>In perhaps no part of a work of the present kind is it more
important than it is here to distinguish between the different
kinds of value, for the special purpose, of the period in question.
If you judge this by its positive contributions to the standard
literature of literary criticism, it has absolutely nothing of consequence
to advance but the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span>. There is not
very much else at all; and what there is consists mainly
of agreeable babblings, of schoolbooks, and of incidental utterances,
which at best can be taken as a kind of <em>semeiotic</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari</cite></span> itself, the Middle Ages lodged such a
diploma-piece as has been scarcely half-a-dozen times elsewhere
seen in the history of the world. And, what is still more important,
their contributions to productive literature were such
that they take, from the catholic point of view, equal rank as a
whole with those of classical and those of modern times, while,
for the special critical purpose, they are almost more valuable
than either. Enforced and necessary ignorance of what the
Middle Ages had to teach accounts in almost every case for
whatever shortcomings we find in the Classics; wilful or careless
ignoring of this accounts for most of the shortcomings of
the moderns; recourse to it accounts for most of the merits,
such as they are, of the criticism of the nineteenth century.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>The critic who knows his Middle Ages, knowing also ancient
and modern literature, and he alone, has the keys of the criticism
of the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the excellent and astonishing accomplishment of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De
Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span> enough has been said already, and it will not
require extensive surveys to show the small accomplishment in
criticism of the Middle Ages elsewhere. It is almost enough to
consider, as we have done, the work of Chaucer, their next man
to Dante in genius<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c008'><sup>[613]</sup></a> as a known personality. Chaucer had all
or almost all the necessary qualifications of a critic—a real
knowledge of literature, a distinctly satirical humour, a large
tolerance, a touch, decided but not too frequent, of enthusiasm,
an interest in a very wide range of different subjects and forms.
And he is actually a critic in embryo, and more, throughout his
work. The <cite>Boethius</cite> and the <cite>Astrolabe</cite>, the <cite>Rose</cite> and the <cite>Troilus</cite>,
half the <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>, more than half the minor works, are
saturated with literature—could have come from no author but
one who was saturated with literature. There is uncrystallised
criticism on every page; there is even some crystallised criticism
in the <cite>Sir Thopas</cite>, and perhaps elsewhere. But almost always
“it is not so expressed,” and for once Shylock is justified of his
refusal to find it. In Chaucer, the strange mediæval levelling
of authors, not merely in respect of trustworthiness, but in
respect of positive value, continues. Macrobius is as Cicero;
Dares is much more than Homer. If he gives an opinion, it is
a moral one. He puts the rejection of alliteration on a mere
local ground; and they will not even let us believe that he
laughed at French of Stratford-atte-Bowe from any literary
point of view.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet while the persistent study of Rhetoric is of great importance,
as exhibiting the keeping up of a critical treatment—such
as it is—of literature, the growth of the vernacular Poetics is of
much more, as developing a side of formal criticism which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>destined to become of more and more importance as time went
on, and to have a connection with, and an influence upon, criticism
not merely formal, to which there is no parallel in ancient
times. So far as we have any trustworthy evidence, Greek
prosody was born like Pallas—full-grown and fully armed. It
has no known period of infancy or pupilage: the poets may
devise—may even give their names to—ingenious combinations,
but all these combinations obey one prearranged system. If
the case of Latin is not quite the same, the periods where it is
most significantly different happen to be periods when criticism
had either not come into being or had abdicated its functions.
A <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Prosodia Latina</cite></span>, by Nævius must have been as interesting
as Gascoigne’s <cite>Notes of Instruction</cite>, and might have been as
interesting as the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari Eloquio</cite></span>. A treatise on <cite>Latin
Rhythms</cite> by Prudentius might, in its different way, have had
an interest which is difficult to parallel by anything modern
in actual existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Middle Ages, however, were constrained to grapple with
their problem as it arose. They had, as we have seen, been
constant to <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Artes Poeticæ</cite></span> dealing with Latin: at last they had
begun to face the more difficult question, how to construct and
regulate their own growing vernacular prosody. No doubt, in
these latter attempts, the mechanical prescriptions of the Provençal
and French <cite>Arts</cite> appear more frequently than the philosophical-scientific
consideration of poetical capacities visible in
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Vulgari</cite></span>; but there is no reasonable fault to find with
this. Nor can it be reasonably contested that the extreme
variety, licence, and (if any one likes the word) irregularity of
the greater modern prosodies have given wider range to individual
poetical development than was allowed by the prosodies
of the ancients. Here, as elsewhere, uniformity rather than
variety was probably the aim, and is certainly the achievement,
of the Classics. For one individual and all but inimitable thing,
like the Æschylean modulation of the chorus (so different from
the grave but less throbbing music of Sophocles, and from the
Euripidean tune) or like the Lucretian Hexameter, we find a
dozen resemblances; and, with elaborate combinations like
the Alcaic or Sapphic, the result is, as in the parallel case of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>our Spenserian, or the Jonson-Herbert-<cite>In Memoriam</cite> quatrain
with enclosed rhyme, mainly uniform. But the greater or less
licence of equivalent substitution in the staple English lines—the
octosyllable and decasyllable, for instance—admits of the
impression of a singular personal stamp, and, unless rejected by
the mistake of the individual or the moment, has rarely failed
to produce it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still one returns, and must necessarily return, to the admission
that, to justify the claims here put forward as to the critical
importance of the Middle Ages, one cannot go to their own
explicit and deliberate exercises in criticism. To apply Johnson’s
not quite inspired remark on Fielding and Richardson,
they neither did, nor in all probability could, explain the mechanism
of the timepiece. But they told the time of day with
unerring accuracy; and their records of it have been neglected,
and will be neglected by succeeding ages, only at the peril—which
has already sometimes led to actual shipwreck—of miscalculating
the whole literary reckoning. When the critics of
the Renaissance, followed more or less blindly by those of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, either contumeliously or
in the sheer generous mistake of desire for improvement, turned
their backs, as far as they could, on the products of Mediæval
literature, they not merely shut themselves out from a vast
volume of delight, they not only mistook disastrously the value
of many individuals, but they recklessly deprived themselves
once more—and with far less excuse and greater loss than had
resulted from the similar refusal of the later Greeks—of an inestimable
opportunity for Comparison. And so they once more
barred for themselves the one gate and highway to really universal
criticism of literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the great, the immense, value of the literature of the
Middle Ages consists in its freshness and independence, and
the consequent fashion in which new literary bents and faculties
of the human mind were manifested. The Greeks had, at
any rate so far as we know, neither the advantage nor the disadvantage
of any precedent literature before them; but their
spirit of theory and of philosophising, while it helped to concentrate
and intensify the peculiar virtue of their product,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>tended also to narrow and stereotype their range. Latin
suffered from the double drawback of system and model. And
modern literature itself has not, with all its achievements, been
able to free itself from the inevitable consequences of ancestry.
It is a great deal too literary; it has, in almost all cases, the
obsession of the library, and the printed book, upon it. It is
deliberate, preoccupied, interested; it has all sorts of cants,
prejudices of education or emancipation, purposes, reminiscences,
unacknowledged and often unconscious trammels and
twitches. Its fountains are very rarely of living water; they
are fed from carefully constructed and collected reservoirs, if not
by positive distillation from the great sea of older literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, with all their slavish docility, all their writing in
schools and groups and batches, all their adoption of tags and
texts, the Middle Ages and their literature present a spectacle
which is exactly the reverse of this. The authors have the
appearance of following; they are really straying, each at the
dictation of his own tastes and instincts only. You may as
well try to teach a cat to do anything in any but her own way
as a mediæval writer. When he copies a Romance, he will
change the names if he does nothing else: but probably he
will do much else, writing it in sixains if his model is in couplets,
in decasyllabics if his original is octosyllabic, and so forth.
Nothing shall induce him to keep historical distinctions or
philosophical differences. His hero<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c008'><sup>[614]</sup></a> shall be as beautiful as
“Paris of Troy, <em>or</em> Absalom, <em>or</em> Partenopex”; his story of
Alexander shall blend sober history and the wildest fiction,
with a coolness which is only not reckless because it does not
see anything to reck. Formal restrictions of the minor kind,
prosodic and other, he will observe devoutly, because they come
naturally to him and are of his own devising; but any restrictions
of literary theory he utterly ignores. His Muse will wear
no stays, though she does not disdain ornaments.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reward of this obedience to Nature was signal. In the
first place the Middle Ages created, or practically created, the
STORY. Of course there were stories before; of course the
<cite>Odyssey</cite> would be the best story in the world if, of the main elements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>of Romance—Passion and Mystery—one were a little
more developed, and is almost the best story in the world as it
is. Of course there are capital <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>fabliaux</i></span> in Herodotus, fine apologues
in Plato, good things of other kinds elsewhere. But the
ancients not only hampered themselves by almost always telling
their longer stories in verse, but seldom knew how to manage
them in verse or prose. The <cite>Iliad</cite> is such a bad story that
it has tempted the profanity of those who would make it not
one but a dozen stories; the <cite>Æneid</cite> is a story, dull <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à dormir
debout</i></span> as such, with some good rambling and fighting, a great
descent to Hades, a capital boxing-match, not a bad regatta,
and a famous but borrowed episode of passion. Out of Herodotus,
till we come to the very verge of the classical period
with Apuleius and Lucian, it is almost impossible to find a
Greek, quite impossible to find a Roman, who knows how to
tell a story at all. The exquisite substance of mythology receives
no due honour from the story-teller as such. Read
Ovid (who had as much of the story-telling spirit in him
as any ancient except Herodotus), and then turn to what is
often the mere doggerel and jargon of the mediæval Latin
story-tellers in prose and verse. The gift, no matter whether
it came from the East or from the West, from the North or
from the South, from the Heaven above or the earth beneath,
or rose a new Aphrodite from the Atlantic sea, is here and is
not there.</p>

<p class='c001'>Without this gift of story-telling there could not have
appeared—though it would not by itself have been enough to
produce—the greater gift of the Romance. It would be as
unnecessary as it would be foolish to enter here into the secular
and truceless war as to the origin, the nature, and so forth of
this famous thing. It is sufficient to observe, once more, that
the thing is here and is not there, except almost by accident.
And the gift of the Romance—in that wide historical sense in
which it could be, and was, in the Middle Ages applied to
almost every manner of subject—was a gift to literature so
inestimable that perhaps no other has ever quite equalled it. At
once, with that nonchalance (they called it <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>nonchaloir</i></span>) in which
no time has ever equalled these Ages, they swept away the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>Doctrine of the Subject, with all the cants and heresies which
pullulate round its undoubtedly noble articles of original faith.
Romance was perfectly prepared to deal with any subject, from
religion to stag-hunting, from chronology to love. It depended
no doubt on the individual craftsman whether the result was
good or bad; but the method has, in the right hands, triumphed
over the most intractable materials, added charm to the most
commonplace, made the most grotesque acceptable. Could
anything be thinner and more ordinary than the subject of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Floire et Blanchefleur</cite></span>? Can anything be more charming, not
merely than its most perfect outcome in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Aucassin et Nicolette</cite></span>,
but even than the diffuser and less happily phrased verse-forms?
In the Arthurian Legend the success is greater still.
Romance takes a dim personality, and a handful of cacophonous
place-names, out of a suspicious compilation of pseudo-history,
and spins it, in a single lifetime, into a story the most elaborate,
the most artful, the most variedly interesting, the fullest of
meaning (if men <em>must</em> have meaning) in the whole literary world.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even to Dante it did not occur to subject the methods and
the results of this new and potent kind to such an examination
as that which Aristotle had partly given to the older
literature. Nor, at that time and in those circumstances, was
even Dante likely to have led such an inquiry to a good end.
The Middle Ages, while consciously abandoning, almost or
altogether, the old aim at Action, had not arrived at the
modern command of Character. They worked at and by
mediate things—Incident, Atmosphere, Description, Manners,
Passion—and they made all these and others subserve a
Romantic Unity of plot which, instead of being circular like
the Classical Unity, was calculated for indefinite prolongation,
not merely in straight line, but after the manner of a tree,
with branches and inarchings skyward, earthward, and horizontal.
The scheme admitted adornments of various kinds,
which must have been difficult if not impossible to reconcile
with the more sober and exacting classical model. It permitted
a much greater indulgence of the resort to the methods
of other arts, especially painting, than classical literature had,
until its latest days, thought proper. It paid very little attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>to mere probability. All these points invited the comparative
critic, but they did not find him. In three respects,
however, the difference between classical and mediæval Imitation
or Representation was almost more striking than in
any other, and all of these presented the most tempting
opportunities for criticism. These were the attitude of the
new literature to Religion, its attitude to the passion of Love,
and its use of an implement which, though by no means
unknown to Classical literature, had been more sparingly used
therein, the method of Allegory.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the first point it would be very easy to enlarge beyond
the widest toleration of this treatise; it is here only necessary
to point out how delicate, and how important, are the new
duties prescribed to the critic of mediæval literature in regard
to it. The “blinded Papist” view (which makes itself felt even
in some observations of such a man as Scott now and then)
may not be so common as it once was, but it is not entirely
obsolete. And it may be doubted whether that to which it has
given place—a philosophical pity, contemptuous or sympathising,
for “superstition” generally—is not even more hampering,
while there can be no doubt of the hamper imposed on the
yet earlier Renaissance by the superior contempt which it felt
for mediæval childishness and ignorance. In this literature,
and in the romantic branch of it more particularly, allowance
has to be made at every moment, in every respect and condition,
for the omnipresence of an elaborate creed which nobody
doubted, with which everybody indeed was so saturated and
familiar that he could jest with it and at it, as one jests with
and at a best-beloved and best-known person and friend. It
supplies subject, it affects treatment, it colours phrase and
image. Although it is very easy to underrate the amount of
actual religious feeling in antiquity, yet this feeling, at its
noblest and sincerest, was unquestionably of an entirely different
character from that of the “Ages of Faith.” Take, at their
best and strongest, the sincere fetichism of the ancient equivalent
of the “charcoal-burner,” the beautiful mythology of the
poet, the sublime mysticism of the Platonist, and the exalted
if slightly Pharisaical morality of the better Stoic—combine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>them with all the art of the student of development. But you
will not succeed in making anything in the least like the creed
of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, with Christ, or rather
with the Virgin and the Devil, fighting perpetually for Mansoul,
with Angels and Deadly Sins under their command, with a miracle
possible at every moment, Death and Fortune ruling affairs
subject to, but not always interfered with by, the higher influences,
the Sacraments to be resorted to at will or neglected at
peril, Purgatory to be faced or anticipated and won through,
Hell or Heaven for final goal. It is almost impossible to allow
too much in degree (though it is extremely possible to allow
wrongly in kind) for the influence which this ever-present
set of thoughts, beliefs, feelings, which was absent from antiquity
and present in the Middle Ages, had upon the literary
utterance of the latter. The unnatural gloom and the half-inarticulate
gaiety which have been discovered in this literature
(the latter at least as truly as the former), its occasional irrationality,
as we are pleased to call it (perhaps “irrationalism”
would be a better word), its shuddering attraction for the horrible
and loathsome, its delight in dream, its quaint and almost
flighty revulsions and contrasts—all are due to this.</p>

<p class='c001'>Equally a commonplace, and yet still more important to, and
still more neglected by, criticism, is the attitude of the Middle
Ages to Love—which is very mainly conditioned by their
attitude to Religion. The not infrequent, though very idle,
debate as to whether the Venus of chivalry was Urania or
Pandemos is, of course, best avoided by the frank acknowledgment
that she was (as indeed Her Divinity always has been)
both. The distinction from antiquity, and its influence upon
literature, do not lie in the least in this direction, or in the
fact of the mixture, but in its nature and character. With
exceptions, of course, the tone of antiquity in literature, as to
love and to its objects, is either the tone of slightly unreal
philosophising, or the tone of the naughty story, or that of half-paraded,
half-confessing contempt. The two former require
no treatment here; the latter is important. Love and its
objects are, to an average serious man of letters of the Classics
when not a subject for conventional escapades, a rather regrettable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>incident attached to humanity, something not in the least
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>spoudaion</i></span>, something only not among the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>parerga</i></span> of life
because it is almost impossible to avoid them, something useful,
not unpleasant, rather better than a constitutional or a bath,
but affording a much less worthy employment than talking in
a porch, or declaiming in a school. This is undeniably the
average attitude of the average man of letters of old. That of
his mediæval brother need hardly be described; but its causes
come within our view. You have to reckon, not merely with
the cult of the Virgin, as has often been done, but with the
whole Christian (especially mediæval-Christian) theory of morals
and of sin. Why excite yourself about actions indifferent at
best, always rather below the attention of a serious man, and
at worst leading to unpleasant and dubious consequences?
Excitement becomes easy when the consequence of a moment’s
guilty indulgence may be the Inferno for eternity. Nay, from a
less purely selfish point of view there are reasons enough. Imagination—the
real Imagination of Apollonius or Philostratus, not
the mere image-furnishing faculty of the ancients generally—had
“come to town,” and brought a transformed Love with her.
The sense of mystery, of miracle, of the invisible, grafted itself
upon the strongest of the merely physical instincts, and the
result pervaded literature. The trumpery subject, proper for
comedy, for epic episodes, for a carefully kept-under seasoning
to tragedy, for light trifles, became, with Religion, the subject
of nearly all poetry, and of not a little prose, and made its
influence felt in all manner of ways. It even, although the
Middle Age was confessedly not strong in character, paved the
way to that last grace, thanks to the fancy of the time for
rehandling the same subjects and persons. Trace Briseis-Briseida,
a fashion-plate in Dares, a slave-girl in Benoist, to
the Cressida of Chaucer and of Henryson; trace Guanhumara,
a handsome Roman damsel of good family and nothing more,
down to the complex woman and Queen of the complete
<cite>Lancelot</cite>, and you will see how character-drawing arose.</p>

<p class='c001'>But undoubtedly one of the greatest, and perhaps the
most characteristic, of the influences of the love-motive on
literature, and the development of literary methods through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>this and other motives, is the mediæval use of Allegory. The
thing, of course, is not new—nothing ever is in the strict
sense. It may actually have dwelt upon the banks of Nile:
it certainly did on those of Ilissus and Tiber. But the very
strong prominence of it in the Scriptures, and in ecclesiastical
writings generally, could not fail to develop it in the younger
vernaculars; and its alliance (a dangerous one no doubt, but a
real and natural) with Imagination could not long be missed.
Many ingenious and industrious hands have traced its origin
from Homer to Claudian, and from Claudian to the <cite>Romance of
the Rose</cite>. How it thence coloured all literature is sufficiently
known. But no critic has even yet exhausted, nor are a
hundred critics likely to exhaust, the subtle and innumerable
ramifications of its literary influence and manifestations.</p>

<p class='c001'>These things and others showed themselves no doubt mainly
in the Romance—the chief, the most characteristic, and, so far
as anything is original, the most original of the literary products
of the Middle Ages. But the Romance was far indeed
from being the only new development in literary morphology
that the period had to offer. Until nearly its closing time, no
great change or advance was made in History, though the
artificial speech, which ancient exaggerations of oratory had
imposed on the historian, was to a great extent dropped, and
the purview of the writer was insensibly widened in other
directions. But the immense cultivation of the short tale—first
in verse, then in prose—was a matter closely connected, but by
no means identical, with the progress of Romance itself. And,
as in another matter glanced at above, the restless character of
the time, and its constant tendency to reproduce with slight
alteration, had, here also, a great influence. In all these alterations
the arts and crafts of the future novelist and dramatist
were insensibly exercising themselves. But the drama itself
demands at least a glance. That the modern play owes nothing
to the mediæval is the foolishest of critical delusions; but it
would hardly be rash to say that the mediæval drama owes
nothing to the ancient. When the horror with which (for not
such very bad reasons) the Church regarded stage plays altogether
had been a little relaxed, the natural and the artificial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>dramas followed entirely different lines. Hroswitha’s work, and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Christus Patiens</cite></span>, and the rest, have absolutely nothing to do
with Miracle or Mystery or Farce, which are the romance and
the short story thrown, according to the natural histrionic bent
of man, into presentation by personages instead of by continuous
narration. And the laws which they developed, and by
which they helped the greater and more genuine modern drama
to be what it was, were natural likewise, and had nothing to do
with Aristotle or with Horace, with Plato or with Aristophanes.</p>

<p class='c001'>This would by itself have sufficed to give the new drama a
very different nature, and therefore a most important comparative
critical influence, when contrasted with the old. The
Greek drama (which the Roman more or less slavishly copied)
may have had its infancies; but we possess it only in its riper
age. Nor is it even possible that these infancies, granting their
existence, could have shown anything like the multiform influences
which betray themselves in the mediæval drama. Both
may have been originally liturgic; but there is such an infinite
difference in the complexity of the liturgies! Both may have
been preceded by epic and perhaps lyric; but in other respects
the Greek drama was certainly among the first—as the
mediæval drama was nearly the last—to take rank among
literary kinds. And these differences, putting others aside,
would have accounted, in great part, for the singularly undulating
and diverse character which (in company, no doubt, with an
imperfection as great as the diversity) distinguished the new
drama from the splendid, but somewhat narrow, perfection of
the old. Even in the stock types, in the Vices and Fools of the
new form, there was little or nothing of the fixed character
of the Roman—we can say little of the Greek—"comedy
of art."</p>

<p class='c001'>And so, not merely in more kinds of literature than one, but
in every kind of literature, with hardly a single exception, the
Middle Ages provided their successors with the material for an
entirely new Calculus of Critical Variations—for a complete
redressing of whatever positive errors or mere relative gaps had
existed in the older criticism, by reason of the absence of
opportunities for observation.</p>

<p class='c021'>Nor can it be regarded as any great drawback to the critical
position of the Renaissance to which we are coming—and the
grounds and data of which it is desirable to survey in
advance, by way of retrospect over the contents of the
present volume—that this immense provision of new critical
material was not accompanied by many, or indeed (with the one
great exception, soon to be known, but to be hardly in the least
heeded) any, accomplished exercises in critical method. For
these, as has been pointed out, were not likely to have been very
good; and, good or bad, they were nearly sure to have been
neglected, or to have done positive harm by way of mere
reaction. Moreover, it was easily and perfectly open to the
Renaissance to create for itself in this department. By its
recovery—no longer in half-measure, and less than half-light,
but in full—of the literature of antiquity, it had been put in
possession, not merely of the other great masses of literary
material, but of quite admirable examples of critical method
itself. Quintilian, Horace, Cicero, the Greek and Latin
Rhetoricians, were among its inherited possessions, and it had
certainly had the <cite>Poetics</cite>, though little attention had for a long
time been paid to them. But they were soon put before it
afresh: and, what is more, the discovery of Longinus also was
soon made. Horace, with his arbitrary rules, and his enforced,
but probably not at all unwelcome, abstinence from any dry
exhibition of material and examples, was no doubt, with all his
merits, a very dangerous mentor. But with Aristotle, Quintilian,
and Longinus at hand as preceptors of method, and
practically all then existing literature, classical and mediæval,
at hand as storehouse of matter, a man of the mid-sixteenth
century had only himself to blame if he did not hit upon at
least the main and general articles of the critical Catholic Faith.
He might not anticipate the magnificent and almost unbelievable
new developments of literature which were actually to take
place, in the three western countries of Europe, within a very
few years; but he would have been none the worse critic for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>that. The critic is, by his profession, not in the least bound to
be a prophet. But he had every document necessary to correct
the chief shortcomings of the ancients, to enlarge the classification
of literary kinds, to rearrange the nature, degrees, and
methods of the literary assault on the senses and the soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be undue anticipation to discuss what he did instead
of this; or to give in detail the positive influences which worked
upon him in preferring his actual alternative. But it is matter
of undoubted history that he did not do what he might have done,
and it is matter of relevance here to give the reasons, as far as
they are retrospective, why he did not do it.</p>

<p class='c001'>To a considerable extent the explanation, and if not the
justification, the excuse, of his failure lie in a well-known and
constantly repeated phenomenon which, on this particular
occasion, showed itself with unusual, indeed with elsewhere
unexampled, distinctness and power. Every age and every
individual (it has been said often, but can never be said too
often), unless it or he is a mere continuation of predecessors, is
unjust to these predecessors. Examples are not necessary; the
merest moment’s thought will supply them in profusion. But
there were numerous and powerful conditions and forces which
made this injustice certain to be more violent and more lasting
here than in almost any other case. No known “dispensation”
exists historically of anything like the same length, the same
intensity, the same uniformity as that which characterises in all
things, and certainly not least in matters literary, the thousand
years of the Middle Age at its widest stretch. And this would
of itself be sufficient to bring about a reaction of corresponding
violence and duration. But to this general aspect of the whole
period must be added the particular aspect of its final stage.
Except in Italy (which had never been intensely or characteristically
mediæval, and which had practically ceased to be so, in
any sense not external, soon after Dante’s time) the fifteenth
century had been a period of decadence, or of transition, or of
stagnation, in almost every European country. It is possible,
though it is not probable, that minds in which the critical spirit
was reawakening might have taken a juster view of things if the
fresh examples then before them, to be compared with Homer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>Lucretius, Thucydides, had been Dante, Chaucer, Froissart. But
there was some excuse for an indignant pooh-poohing of the mere
possibility of comparison, when the persons, to be compared immediately
with the great writers of antiquity, were the dreary
and bombastic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rhétoriqueurs</i></span> of the French, or the shambling
versifiers of the English, fifteenth century.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Renaissance, moreover, was likely to be led wrong by
that constant delusion of matter, that fatal attraction towards
the subject, which, as this <cite>History</cite> endeavours to show, has led
Criticism wrong a dozen times for once that it has led her right.
The mediæval forms of literature were identified, allied, in fact
saturated, with certain beliefs and modes of thought—scholastic
philosophy, Catholic religion, aristocratic politics. To the pure
Platonist on the one hand and the thorough-going Aristotelian on
the other, to the reformer on the one hand and the freethinker
on the other, to the democrat on the one hand and the believer
in Machiavellian statecraft on the other, all these things were
partly horrible, partly idiotic, altogether to be shaken off and
refused. The natural, but in the main irrational and frivolous,
weariness of an old fashion was supplemented, inspirited, made
far more vehement and dangerous, by the deliberate and
reasoned, if not reasonable, antipathy to, and revolt against, an
old faith. It has been acknowledged already that the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Morte
d’Arthur</cite></span> would have fared as badly with Augustine as it did
with Ascham; but the moral provocation would not have been
aggravated to Augustine, as it was perhaps to Ascham, certainly
to more thorough-going Protestants than he, by the distinct
connection between the Graal Legend and the doctrine of Transubstantiation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Accordingly, the Renaissance indulged itself, and left to its
successors, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (different as
they were from itself in many ways), an amount of “unintelligent
scorn” of the past which, if it does credit to nothing else,
does credit at least to the vigour and intensity of the time.
Sometimes this scorn was vocal and argumentative, as in Ascham
himself, in Du Bellay, in others. More often, and with a subtler
mischief still, it was silent, implicit, apparently exchanged for
mere negligence. The childish things were simply put away,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>despatched to the lumber-room, and left there. And it was this
negligence, rather than the scorn, which did harm to the criticism
of the periods that followed. It does not do the critic unmitigated
harm to take the wrong side now and then; he exercises
himself at his weapons, he can acquire dexterity in them, and
very often (Dryden is a notable example) he teaches himself
orthodoxy in the very act of fighting for the heterodox. But
when he allows himself to ignore, great gulfs or smaller pits
open for him at once. That is what he can never afford to do;
that is the cause of all the errors which have beset his kind, from
the beginning of critical things until the present day. One of
the most excellent and admirable of librarians once replied to a
childish question of the present writer, “What do you do with
the rubbish?” “It is rather difficult, you see, to know what is
rubbish to-day; and quite impossible to know what will be
rubbish to-morrow.” And while this is more especially true of
the critic, who can with safety pass nothing, at least unexamined,
as rubbish, his case is more dangerous still than that of the
librarian, who has but to arrange what he has got in orderly
fashion, and prepare plentiful shelves for what is coming.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the critic, as we have seen, it is different. He must
always generalise at his peril, and subject to the upset of
his generalisations by fresh discoveries. But he can at least be
careful of the “without prejudice,” and he can at least neglect
nothing that is within his reach, in his processes of observation
and comparison. The earlier Greek critics erred, as we have
seen, partly because of a necessary and guiltless deprivation.
But their venial sin became more of a mortal one, when they
not only assumed that there was nothing save what they knew
in Greek, but deliberately ignored the opportunities, not of
sovereign but of considerable efficacy, which were offered them
by Latin. The Latin critics erred, partly by the same assumption,
and partly by converting the despite of Latin into a
slavish and unintelligent adoration of Greek, and not always
the best Greek. The Middle Age was innocent, as hardly indulging
in criticism at all. But the Renaissance critics at first
committed, and to far too great an extent handed on, a combination
of the sins of their classical teachers. They assumed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>stationary state of literary kinds and qualities, as both Greeks
and Romans had done; they adulated classical literature, like
the Romans in regard to Greek; they despised mediæval literature,
like the Greeks in relation to Latin. And, as we shall see,
they had their reward.</p>

<p class='c001'>But I should be sorry to end not merely a chapter but a Book,
not merely a Book but a volume, without a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>caveat</i></span> against
possible misconstruction of the words “fault,” “error,” “sin,”
“mischief,” “misfortune,” and the like, which have just been
used, not merely in this context, but throughout the volume
itself. There have been, I believe, persons unfortunate enough
to be dissatisfied with the moral and physical government of
the universe—persons who have sadly pronounced it “a crank
machine” in many ways. These things are not my trade.
But, in matters literary, I must plead guilty to being something
of an optimist. Not that I think all literature good—that
is not precisely the conclusion to which a thirty years’
practice of criticism brings one. In the critical land, as in the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pays des amours</i></span>, the shore where one always loves is a shore of
which it must be said that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>on ne la connaît guère</i></span>. There is,
indeed, a certain critical delight in reading even the worst books,
so long as they are positively and not merely negatively bad—but
that is another matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The point on which I am contented to be called a critical
Pangloss is this, that I have hardly the slightest desire to alter—if
I could do so by the greatest of all miracles, that of retro-active
change—the literary course of the world. No doubt
things might have been better still—one may there agree with
the pious divine on his strawberry. But one may also be
perfectly contented with the actual result. I have endeavoured
to show that, however we may feel bound to pronounce Greek
literature incomplete in this or that department, and still more
Greek criticism imperfect in its assumptions and of questionable
adequacy in its methods, yet Greek criticism was the criticism
which was wanted, to register and to preserve the qualities
which have made Greek literature perhaps the most indispensable
possession among the now goodly list of the literatures of the
world. I have endeavoured further to show that the two conflicting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>strains or streams in Latin criticism correspond, in a
manner “necessary and voluptuous and right,” on the one hand,
to the ordered correctness and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>venustas</i></span> which are the notes of
the Latin spirit on its Academic side; on the other, to the under-current
of half-barbaric gorgeousness which there, as elsewhere,
now and again asserted itself—with no small benefit to the
world’s letters.</p>

<p class='c001'>And so, also, in this chapter and the Book which precedes it,
I have tried to show that the immense provision of new kinds
of literature by the Middle Age, side by side with its almost
total abstinence from criticism, was the best thing that could
have happened. Nor is it impossible that, if we are able to
pursue the inquiry, we shall find that the new differentia of
the Renaissance period and that which followed to the Romantic
revival—the curious fact that almost all its criticism went one
way, while almost all its best creation went dead in the teeth
of that criticism—has again worked mainly if not wholly for
good. But this is for the future. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Si laisse ore à tant li contes à

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
